      "Discussion Paper on1. Alternate Capital Raising Platform and2. Review of other regulatory requirements1. Background1.1. With a view to provide easier exit options for informed investors like Angel Investors, Venture Capital Funds (VCFs), etc, SEBI Board in its meeting held on June 25, 2013, approved a proposal to permit listing of SMEs in Institutional Trading platform (ITP) without having to make an IPO.1.2. While such companies are listed on the ITP, they are not permitted to raise equity capital through public issues though they can continue to make private placements. SEBI has been in receipt of suggestions to permit capital raising in the said ITP platform.1.3. Further, as part of the regular consultative process, SEBI in the recent past interacted with iSPIRT (which stands for 'Indian Software Product Industry Round Table', a body dedicated to promote existing Indian software product companies). A few Indian start-ups were also present during the said interaction. It was highlighted that there are around 3000 Indian start-up companies with the pace of setting up such companies picking up lately and that Indian software product companies are impacting nearly 3 million small businesses. They highlighted certain challenges facing the industry players to create a regulatory awareness of the typical needs of the industry.1.4. While recognizing the availability of SME platform for facilitating capital raising by small scale businesses and presence of the novel SME-ITP to facilitate exit of institutional investors like PEs, it was submitted that these existing avenues may be further made amenable for accommodating a larger number of growing companies.1.5. Further, Association of Investment Bankers of India (AIBI), an association of investment bankers in India has submitted suggestions to SEBI to facilitate issuers with lower holding of founding members. AIBI has also been requesting clarifications on applicability of certain provisions of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 (ICDR Regulations) in respect of such companies.2. Need for review 2.1. Under the ICDR Regulations, the promoters are required to offer a minimum 20% of post issue capital as lock-in for a period of 3 years. The lock-in provision ensures promoters' skin in the game for a period of at least 3 years. 2.2. Further, the detailed disclosure on objects of the issue and basis for issue price ensures that the company justifies the price at which it plans to issue shares and the purpose for which the amount raised shall be utilized. 2.3. The said requirements are intended to ensure that interest of investors, especially the retail investors, is protected. However, many start-up companies that have flourished in recent times and several of which have also achieved scale, have lower founding members' holding (often less than 20%) and a large holding of institutional investors. 2.4. Thus, founding members of such companies are not in a position to offer the shares for lock-in. It is also cited that such founding members do not have sufficient resources to acquire additional shares to offer for lock in. Further, such companies are often professionally run and hence the founding members are not inclined to be disclosed as promoters. 2.5. Such companies are often loss-making and belong to sectors for which there are no comparable financial ratios available. 2.6. The institutional investors of such companies generally advise these companies to list overseas citing relaxed regulatory regime in other jurisdictions. In the past, a few measures to relax certain requirements have already been taken by SEBI. However, considering the unique nature of such companies, they seek differential treatment. 2.7. If the capital raising process in India is not made further relaxed for such issuers, they may be driven to list on stock exchanges outside India. It has been a challengeAlternate Capital Raising Platform and other regulatory requirements\tPage 2for SEBI to simplify the capital raising process for such issuers while protecting the interest of retail investors.2.8. Considering the role of such companies in nation building and their potential in terms of generating employment and income as well as fostering innovation, it is imperative that necessary enabling environment is provided for these enterprises to flourish.2.9. Various suggestions in this regard were deliberated in the Primary Market Advisory Committee (PMAC) of SEBI.2.10. Pursuant to the recommendations of PMAC and further discussions, a proposal on alternate capital raising platform wherein money shall be raised only from institutions and high net worth individuals by the new-age companies having innovative business model and belonging to knowledge-based technology sector is detailed below. On account of the risk involved in investing in such companies, it is proposed that retail investors be restricted from investing in such companies.3. Proposal on Alternate Capital Raising Platform3.1. Eligibility3.1.1. Going by the developments in the USA, Europe, China and other markets, it is noted that young entrepreneurs are coming out with innovations which are leading to creation of technology companies which are bringing in completely new business opportunities by facilitating creation of new products for consumers or are contributing towards system improvement and process efficiencies in existing operation of companies. Many of the companies have the characteristic that their knowledge based product is not widely understood or appreciated by large number of investors. They do not incur profits in the initial years, but have potential to grow in a big way in a short time frame. It is a global phenomenon that many of them are getting acquired by large companies at high valuations. Innovators are therefore, looking for an environment where their inner strength and potential is fairly recognised.3.1.2. In India such an eco system has come in existence in many parts of the country such as Karnataka, Kerala, NCR, Maharashtra, etc. For want of a betterAlternate Capital Raising Platform and other regulatory requirements\tPage 3price discovery within the country, many of these companies plan to get listed in Singapore or the USA.3.1.3. One of the challenges in coming out with a special carve out in these knowledge based industries is to define them. It is proposed that the new platform for raising money within the country will be initially made applicable to companies which are in the area of software product development, e-commerce, new-age companies having innovative business model, etc. which create new business opportunities or which serve important efficiency enhancement in existing business activities.3.2. Modified Institutional Platform3.2.1. Capital raising shall be allowed on the ITP with certain modifications in the current regulatory framework that may include relaxation on restriction of fund raising, minimum investment from certain category of investors, etc3.2.2. The proposed platform will have two categories of investors i.e. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) and Non-institutional investors (NII). It has been suggested that the family trusts may also be allowed to apply under the QIB category.3.2.3. Allotment to QIBs may be on a discretionary basis whereas to NIIs it shall be on proportionate basis. Allocation between the said two categories shall be in the ratio of 75% and 25% respectively. Any under subscription in non-institutional categories shall be available to QIB category3.2.4. No QIBs shall be allotted more than 5% of the issue size3.2.5. The minimum application size in case of such issues shall be Rs. 10 lakhs3.2.6. The minimum no. of allottees in such issues shall be 5003.2.7. The listing on institutional platform shall be for a period of at least 1 year.Post-1 year, the company will have the option to migrate to main board subject to compliance with eligibility requirements of the Stock Exchanges3.2.8. The minimum trading lot on the said platform shall be of Rs. 5 lakhs. There is also a suggestion that this threshold limit on trading lot be lowered for sale of shares by the employees who have been granted ESOPs3.2.9. For Category I and II AIFs, which are required under the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 to invest a certain minimum amount inAlternate Capital Raising Platform and other regulatory requirements\tPage 4unlisted securities, investment in shares of companies listed on this platform may be treated as investment in 'unlisted securities' for the purpose of calculation of the investment limits.3.3. Process3.3.1. New-age companies having innovative business model and belonging to knowledge-based technology sector, where no person (individually or collectively with persons acting in concert) holds 25% or more of the pre-issue share capital, may be considered as professionally managed companies and access capital through the said institutional platform. In other words, companies where any person (individually or collectively with persons acting in concert) holds 25% or more of the pre-issue share capital shall access capital through the existing main board3.3.2. Such issuers shall be required to file draft offer document with SEBI for observations, as provided in ICDR Regulations. The issuers shall ensure compliance with various applicable provisions in ICDR Regulations (including disclosures on key managerial personnel and business model), subject to the following carve-outs.3.4. Objects of the issuesExisting RegulationSchedule VIII - Part A (VII) of ICDR Regulations requires disclosure of the objects of the issue, inter-alia on the purpose of issue, means of financing such project, proposed deployment status of the proceeds at each stage of the project, Interest of promoters and directors, etcProposalThe main object may be for general corporate purpose. Further, the disclosure may be restricted to only broad objects. This is in line with the major international jurisdictions.Alternate Capital Raising Platform and other regulatory requirements\tPage 53.5. Lock-in of SharesExisting RegulationRegulation 36 (a) of ICDR Regulation stipulates that the minimum promoters' contribution (20% of post issue capital) shall be locked in for a period of 3 years from the date of commencement of commercial production or date of allotment in public issue, whichever is later. Further, Regulation 36(b) of ICDR Regulation stipulates that promoters holding in excess of minimum promoters contribution shall be locked-in for a period of one year:Regulation 37 of ICDR Regulation stipulates that the entire pre-issue capital held by persons other than promoters shall be locked-in for a period of one year, subject to exemptions carved out for certain cases.ProposalLock in of the entire pre-issue capital should be for a period of 6 months uniformly for all shareholders.3.6. Basis of Issue PriceExisting RegulationSchedule VIII - Part A (VII) (K) of ICDR Regulations requires the disclosure of the basis for issue price including disclosure of Earnings Per Share, Diluted Earnings Per Share, Price earnings ratio, pre-issue Average Return on Net Worth, etc.ProposalThe basis of issue price may include disclosures, other than projections, as deemed fit by the issuers accessing the market on the institutional platform in order to enable investors take informed decisions4. Review of Other Regulatory RequirementsThe Committee further deliberated and recommended that the following provisions shall be applicable for all issuers irrespective of the listing on main board or the institutional platform:Alternate Capital Raising Platform and other regulatory requirements\tPage 64.1.

      "Consultation Paper on Crowdfunding in India1.0 Introduction1.1 This consultation paper aims to provide a brief overview of the global scenario of crowdfunding including the various prevalent models under it, the associated benefits and risks, the regulatory approaches in different jurisdictions etc. The paper also covers the extant legal structure governing the fund raising for start ups and SMEs in India. The paper discusses legal and regulatory challenges in implementing the framework for Crowdfunding. This paper proposes framework for ushering in crowdfunding by giving access to capital market to provide an additional channel of early stage funding to Startups and SMEs and seeks to balance the same with investor protection. Through this consultation paper SEBI intends to invite comments and suggestions from industry and market participants regarding the different possible structures for crowdfunding within the existing legal framework and other associated issues.1.2 The Consultation Paper has been put forward for discussion only and does not necessarily mean that a Crowdfunding Regulation would be introduced in the form as proposed in the consultation paper or in any other form.2.0 What is Crowdfunding?2.1 Crowdfunding is solicitation of funds (small amount) from multiple investors through a web-based platform or social networking site for a specific project, business venture or social cause.2.2 Crowd sourced funding is a means of raising money for a creative project (for instance, music, film, book publication), a benevolent or public-interest cause (for instance, a community based social or co-operative initiative) or a business venture, through small financial contributions from persons who may number in the hundreds orPage 1 of 66thousands. Those contributions are sought through an online crowd-funding platform, while the offer may also be promoted through social media.13.0 Types of Crowd-Funding3.1 As per IOSCO Staff Working Paper - Crowd-funding: An Infant Industry Growing Fast, 2014 ('IOSCO Paper'), Crowd-funding can be divided into four categories: donation crowdfunding, reward crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending and equity crowdfunding.CrowdfundingSocialLending/Donation CrowdfundingRewardCrowdfundingPeer-to-PeerLendingEquityCrowdfundingCommunity CrowdfundingFinancial Return CrowdfundingSource: IOSCO Staff Working Paper - Crowd-funding: An Infant Industry Growing Fast , 20143.2 Donation Crowdfunding3.2.1 Donation crowdfunding denotes solicitation of funds for social, artistic, philanthropicor other purpose, and not in exchange for anything of tangible value.3.2.2 For example, In the US, Kickstarter, Indiegogo etc. are some of the platforms that support donation based crowdfunding.1 Crowd Based Equity Funding  Discussion Paper - Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, Australia, September , 2013Page 2 of 663.3 Reward Crowdfunding3.3.1 Reward crowdfunding refers to solicitation of funds, wherein investors receive some existing or future tangible reward (such as an existing or future consumer product or a membership rewards scheme) as consideration.3.3.2 Most of the websites which support donation crowdfunding, also enable reward crowdfunding, e.g. Kicktstarter, Rockethub etc.3.4 Peer-to-Peer lending3.4.1\tIn Peer-to-Peer lending, an online platform matches lenders/investors withborrowers/issuers in order to provide unsecured loans and the interest rate is set by the platform. Some Peer-to-Peer platforms arrange loans between individuals, while other platforms pool funds which are then lent to small and medium-sized businesses.3.4.2 Some of the leading examples from the US are Lending Club, Prosper etc. and from UK are Zopa, Funding Circle etc.3.4.3 A report by the Open Data Institute in July 2013 found that between October 2010 and May 2013 some 49,000 investors in the UK funded peer-to-peer loans worth more than 378m. 23.4.4 Some of the platforms charge a fee based on the loan origination and have an incentive to push investors into larger loans which may not suit an investors risk profile.3.4.5 Though, Peer-to-peer lending did not appear to involve securities, loan/notes/contracts can be traded on a peer-to-peer platform or a secondary market. Thus, these loans may become securities, with the contract between the lender and the borrower being the security note. 32 Crowd Based Equity Funding  Discussion Paper - Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, Australia, September , 20133 IOSCO Staff Working Paper - Crowd-funding: An Infant Industry Growing Fast , 2014Page 3 of 663.4.6 In peer-to-peer lending, there is no investor protection by way of a compensation scheme to cover defaults in this market as there is with deposit guarantee schemes for bank deposits. Retail investors, who do not have the capacity to absorb defaults, may lose significant proportions of their investments, if there are any defaults.3.4.7 As per IOSCO paper, in some Jurisdiction like Germany and Italy, peer-to-peer platforms are classified as banks (due to their credit intermediation function) and are therefore regulated as banks.3.5 Equity Based Crowdfunding3.5.1 In Equity Based Crowdfunding, in consideration of funds solicited from investors, Equity Shares of the Company are issued.3.5.2 It refers to fund raising by a business, particularly early-stage funding, through offering equity interests in the business to investors online. Businesses seeking to raise capital through this mode typically advertise online through a crowdfunding platform website, which serves as an intermediary between investors and the start-up companies.3.5.3 Traditionally, Start-ups are funded through private equity, angel investor or loan arrangements with a financial institution. Any offering of public equity takes place only after the product or business becomes commercially viable. However, in Equity based Crowdfunding solicitation is done at an earlier stage.Some examples of equity crowdfunding platforms are Syndicate Room, Crowdcube and Seedrs.3.5.4 In a few jurisdictions (like China), these platforms are restricted to offer this type of capital raising to sophisticated investors or to a limited number of individual investors. In China, an equity raising offer made to less than 200 individuals does not need to fulfil the public equity raising requirements.Page 4 of 664.0 Benefits of Crowdfundingi.\tCrowdfunding provides a much needed new mode of financing for start-ups and SME sector and increases flows of credit to SMEs and other users in the real economy.ii.\tFinancial crisis (2008) resulted in failure of number of Banks and, consequently the Basel III Capital adequacy norms have been made applicable to Banks. As a result, Banks have become increasingly constrained in their ability to lend money to the ventures or start-ups which may have high risk element. Hence, there is a need for funding for SME through alternative sources.iii.\tSMEs are able to raise funds at lower cost of capital without undergoing through rigorous procedures in this mode.iv.\tCrowdfunding provides new investment avenue and provides a new product for portfolio diversification of Investors.v.\tIt increases competition in a space traditionally dominated by a few providers (providing finance to Start-ups and SMEs).vi.\tThe operators of a crowdfunding platform may engage in vetting or due diligence of projects to be included on their website, to maintain the reputation of the website.5.0 Risks of Crowdfunding5.1 Substitution of Institutional Risk by Retail Risk5.1.1 Presently, the risk in financing Start-ups and SMEs is borne by the Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) and Private Equity (PE) Investors. In crowdfunding, these entities solicit investments in smaller sums from large number of investors. Hence, the risk taking by VCF/PE (informed investors) is substituted with retail investors, whose risk tolerance level may be very low. Retail investors may not be able to understand the risk in these investments and will be unable to bear the loss of investments.5.1.2 This may be more dangerous, considering the fact that investments in SMEs and Start-up may involve high risk and low liquidity and are generally treated as aggressive and long term investments. VCF/PE Investors will be able to negotiate a better pricingPage 5 of 66and some influence on management, which would be absent in the Crowdfunding Route, where smaller contributions are sought from multiple investors. Uninformed and unsophisticated investors (retail investors) may act with a herd mentality.5.2 Risk of default5.2.1 There is no or less recourse to the investors against the issuer, in case of default or fraud. Funds are not directly solicited by the issuer and issuer also do not come out with any offer document. Funds are solicited by the platform and such platform may or may not conduct proper due diligence of the issuer. If a platform is being temporarily shut down, or closed permanently, no recourse is available to the investors.5.2.2 There is no collateral (even in case of peer to peer lending), as in case of Corporate Bonds. Further, in peer to peer lending, there are no investor protection by way of a compensation scheme to cover defaults like deposit guarantee schemes for bank deposits.5.2.3 Public funding is sought on the basis of future possibilities as against the clear evidence of a viable existing business model, which is needed under the existing regulations. Investments in companies without viable business model increase the risk of failure and loss to equity investors.5.2.4 The risk of failure is further increased by the fact that the funding is potentially by participants who do not have the skills and experience needed to assess the risk before investing/lending, as compared to the VCF/PE Investors, banks or other financial institutions who provides funds under the traditional business model.Eg: Bubble and Balm was a fair trade soap company, who were also the first company to raise funding for their start-up through the equity crowd-funding platform Crowdcube, based in the UK, in 2011. It raised 75,000 in return for 15 per cent of the companys equity from 82 investors, who contributed between 10 and 7,500 each. In July 2013 the business closed overnight, leaving no way ofPage 6 of 66contacting the company or a way to recover losses. The investors lost 100% of their investment.45.3 Risk of Fraud5.3.1 There is possibility of genuine websites being used by fraudsters claiming to bepromoters of projects or of false websites being established, simply to defraud the investors or to entice individuals to provide credit card details etc. Thus, there is a risk of misuse as well as cyber-security and/or identity theft.5.4 Central role of the Internet:5.4.1 Crowdfunding platform is an internet based market place for issuers to sell theirown securities to raise capital. Thus the central role of the Internet and its wide reach would increase the number of persons potentially affected, which can be significantly greater than the traditional means of fundraising. Younger investors may get influenced simply because of its link to social media and the Internet.5.4.2 Funds could be raised from investors residing at various countries without complying with requirement of local laws of various jurisdictions.5.5 Systemic Risk:a) Due to the individual nature of crowdfunding, there is a possibility thatinvestors may not practice good diversification principles.b) There may be no secondary market in which investors can sell their investments and exit and hence, there is a risk of illiquidity.c) There is also possibility of Money laundering.d) These platforms could expose other financial sectors to the risk of default, as occurred during the subprime mortgage crisis. If the rapid growth rate in peer-to-peer lending continues, these risks could become systemic.e) There are Cross-border implications, if the funds are solicited through internet, as there are disparities in Contract Act or securities law application in different jurisdictions.4IOSCO Staff Working Paper - Crowd-funding: An Infant Industry Growing Fast , 2014Page 7 of 665.6 Information Asymmetrya) There is high chance of information asymmetry associated with these platforms, where one party invests/trades based on some information which is unknown to other set of investors. Since there is lack of hard information, there is too much reliance on soft information based on the social networking platforms in this model, which increases the risks.b) There is no monitoring of these platforms, as to which account the money goes.c) There is lack of transparency and reporting obligations on issuers including with respect to the use of funds raised.d) There is possibility of omission of information and misinformation providing distorted view of the issuer or the actual investment, which may result in overestimation of the actual return. This may induce the investors to invest in a product that would not align with their risk tolerance.5.7 Substitution of Existing Regulatory Framework5.7.1 Peer to Peer Lending acts as a Bank by matching lenders/investors with borrowers/issuers, without complying with any of the rigid requirements of Banks.5.7.2 The Disclosure and due diligence involved in Crowdfunding platform cannot be compared with existing framework of public offering through filing of Prospectus with adequate information, which is also subject to the scrutiny of the Regulators. Further, other public issue requirements for equity shares like to have minimum track record for the issuers, minimum promoters' contribution, lock in, and for debt securities like requirement to have trustees, rating by Credit rating agencies etc. may not be applicable in the crowdfunding platforms.5.7.3 Further, even private placement requirements have been tightened in India recently i.e. requirement to have Private Placement Offer Letter, restriction on number of investors to whom it can be made, restrictions on mode of placements, etc. Crowdfunding Platforms may not adhere to any of the said requirements.Page 8 of 666.0 Regulatory framework for Crowdfunding in various Jurisdictions:6.0.1 As of date, very few jurisdictions have come out with regulations for crowdfunding. Some jurisdictions are in the initial stages of introduction with concept papers for feedback of the industry.6.0.2 Two areas that have seen rapid growth in recent years are Peer-to-Peer Lending and Equity Crowdfunding. Financial Reward (FR) crowd-funding globally has grown rapidly in the last 5 years, with data suggesting that the peer-to-peer lending market doubles each year. It accounts for approximately $6.4 billion outstanding globally. Collectively, the US, UK and China make up 96% of the overall FR crowdfunding market, with USA accounting for 51%, China for 28% and UK for 17%.5.6.1 Regulatory PracticesIn Donation crowdfunding and Reward crowdfunding, only donations or grants are solicited and no financial return in the form of a yield or return on investment is expected by the donor/grantor. Hence, such funding mostly falls outside the purview of Securities market regulator. (In India, payment of donations are mainly governed by the provisions of Income Tax Act). Peer-to-Peer Lending, depending upon whether pure lending or any debt securities are issued, are regulated by Banking or Securities market regulator. Crowd Sourced Equity Funding are mostly regulated by Securities market regulator.6.2 Regulation of Peer-to-Peer lending6.2.1 Peer-to-Peer lending is also termed as 'direct consumer lending' or 'marketplace lending'. The Peer-to-Peer lending is approached differently by various regulators, treated as banking by some jurisdictions and as an intermediary in some others, while some jurisdictions like Israel and Japan have prohibited it altogether.6.2.2 As per IOSCO Paper5 , though the nature of regulations concerning Peer-to-Peer Lending varies with nations, these can be broadly divided into different categories.5 'Crowd-funding: An Infant Industry Growing Fast' Staff Working paper of IOSCO Research DepartmentPage 9 of 66Regulatory Regime\tDescription\tCountriesUnregulated\tIn these jurisdictions either\tBrazil, China, Egypt, South Koreathe regulation has classified peer-to-peer lending as an exempt market or there is a lack of definition in legislationIntermediary Regulation\tThis regulates peer-to-peer lending platforms as an intermediary.

While in some jurisdictions such exemption is given only to offer made to accredited/informed/wealthiest investors, others exempts solicitation made through Crowdfunding Platform capping the amount that can be raised or the amount that can be invested by each investor.Page 10 of 666.4 Regulation of Crowdfunding in various Jurisdictions:6.4.1 United StatesJumpstart Our Business Startups Act, 2012 or (JOBS Act) has already proposed a basic regulatory framework to regulate Crowdfunding Platforms.Previously, in U.S. there was a ban on general solicitation or general advertising of investment in securities, other than a prospectus-based offer.Title II of the JOBS Act deals with equity offers to accredited investors. Pursuant to SEC Rules under that Title, in effect from September 2013, US entrepreneurs may publicly advertise and market their companys investment opportunity, of whatever size, to accredited investors (in effect, individuals with over $1 million in liquid net worth or annual incomes over $200,000), including through the Internet or social media, as well as through print, radio or television.Title III of the JOBS Act deals with Crowd Sourced equity Funding (CSEF) offers to investors generally. It is intended to allow start-up and other companies to use online intermediaries to obtain modest amounts of capital. Title III of the Act, the crowdfunding provision, has not yet come into force.Under this act, for a transaction to be qualified as a crowdfunding transaction, it must meet specified requirements, including the following:the amount raised not to exceed $1 million in a 12-month period (this amount is to be adjusted for inflation at least every five years).individual investments in a 12-month period are limited to:o\tthe greater of $2,000 or 5 percent of annual income or net worth, if annual income or net worth of the investor is less than $100,000; ando\t10 percent of annual income or net worth (not to exceed an amount sold of $100,000), if annual income or net worth of the investor is $100,000 or more (these amounts are to be adjusted for inflation at least every five years); andPage 11 of 66transactions must be conducted through an intermediary that either is registered as a broker or is registered as a new type of entity called a funding platform.Crowdfunding requires the issuing company (emerging growth company) to file a disclosure document with SEC at least 21 days prior to first sale, and requires scaled financial disclosure, including audited financial statements for raises of over $500,000.Annual reports must be filed with SEC by the issuer company which completes a crowdfunding round.Funding platforms (but not broker-dealers) cannot: offer investment advice or make recommendations to investors. They cannot solicit transactions for securities offered or displayed on its platform, or compensating employees or agents for doing so. They cannot hold or manage any investor funds or securities.In the US, Kickstarter enabled creative individualsmusicians, filmmakers, writersto fund their work, often with the only return being an advance copy or limited edition of a DVD or other art work, concert tickets, or a signed thank-you note. 66.4.2 New ZealandThe recently enacted Financial Markets Conduct Act, 2013 (the Act) contains provisions designed to facilitate CSEF.The new regulations in New Zealand enables companies to raise up to a maximum of $ 2 Million from 20 investors in a year through crowdfunding without having to issue a prospectus. It covers both the varieties of crowdfunding: Equity Crowdfunding and Peer-to-Peer Lending.The market regulator, Financial Markets Authority, has asked both, equity crowd-funding platforms and peer-to-peer lenders, to apply for a license to operate.6 Crowd Based Equity Funding  Discussion Paper - Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, Australia, September , 2013Page 12 of 666.4.3 AustraliaThe Corporations and Market Advisory Committee (Australian Government) recently came out with a Concept Paper on Crowdfunding and is currently in the process of framing rules for equity based crowdfunding.The current regulations allow a startup to raise not more than $ 20 Million or transfer equity to more than 20 people in any given 12 months. This system restricts this channel to a set of sophisticated investors. These rules are under revision.6.4.4 CanadaCrowdfunding is divided into Non-Equity and Equity Crowdfunding platforms in Canada. Equity Crowdfunding involves the issuance of securities and consist of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and equity transactions.Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), an umbrella organization for different provincial and territorial securities regulators in Canada, has published National Instrument (in 2014) involving prospectus exemptions that include the Offering Memorandum exemption (the OM exemption) which is used by registered dealers to sell securities on the internet to the public. The OM exemption is available in all jurisdictions in Canada, except Ontario, and has been in place for many years.There are registration requirements for Crowd Sourced Equity Funding Platforms, including Integrity, proficiency and solvency requirements, and for the persons operating them.Registration requirement addresses concerns relating to possible conflicts of interest and self-dealing by intermediaries and to avoid fraudulent offerings of securities to investors through the Internet.Page 13 of 666.4.5 United KingdomIn March, 2014 Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) came out with regulations governing the crowdfunding in Britain. The new regime will be applicable to the firms operating loan-based crowdfunding platforms and investment-based crowdfunding platforms.Loan-Based Crowdfunding Platforms: These include peer-to-peer lending platforms or peer-to-business lending platforms on which consumers can invest in loan agreements.Investment-Based Crowdfunding Platforms: These include the platforms on which consumers can buy investments, such as equity or debt securities that are not listed or traded on a recognized exchange, or units in an unregulated collective investment scheme. In other words, these are' non-readily realized securities'.Under the new regulation, investment-based crowdfunding platforms are treated slightly differently to loan-based crowdfunding platforms by the FCA. The new regulations have become effective from April 1, 2014. As a result, the regulation of the consumer credit market has been transferred from the Office of Fair Trading to the FCA. This includes responsibility for regulating loan-based crowdfunding.New Regulations:Loan-Based Crowdfunding Platforms:The new regulations intend to safe guard the interests of the investors by ring fencing the investments from the platform's finances. Therefore in case anything happens to the platform, the investments would not be hurt. The platforms also need to have a contingency plan or a third party in place to ensure seamless operations.Platforms must also have capital reserves to cushion the effect of defaults. Each platform will need to hold 20,000 from October this year and 50,000 from April 2017.Page 14 of 66The new regulations also take a robust view on disclosures. The marketing of the products should not be misleading and all the risks should be adequately highlighted.Unlike savings or bank accounts, neither loan or investment-based crowdfunding is covered by the 85,000 Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Thus loan-based crowdfunding is still very much an investment, rather than savings product.Investors can cancel their agreement without any penalty within a cooling period of 14 days if the firm does not provide access to a secondary market.The new regulations provide access to the financial services ombudsman for all complaints.How are the new Rules different?Many established lending-based platforms are already regulated by FCA and therefore largely compliant to the new regulations. However, the regulations put a structure in place for the platforms to manage their risks properly and not promise some ludicrous return.Investment-Based Crowdfunding Platforms:Very similar rules apply to investment-based crowdfunding as loan-based - i.e. the marketing must be fair and not misleading, risks should be highlighted and systems must be in place to separate your money from theirs - and ensure there are adequate capital reserves.The 14 day cooling off period and access to financial ombudsman also apply.Aside from systems requirements, there are new rules on who is actually allowed to invest their money in crowdfunding. These include:retail clients who are advised,retail clients classified as corporate finance contacts or venture capital contacts,retail clients certified as sophisticated or high net worth, orretail clients who confirm that they will not invest more than 10 per cent of their net investible assets in these products.Page 15 of 66So the onus is really on the investor to ensure they fall into one of the above brackets, rather than the platform. Investors must to tick a box to confirm they fall into one of the above categories.The investors must also pass an online appropriateness test to prove they are aware of the risks. October 1, 2014 is the deadline for the platforms to launch investor tests.An investor can also reclassify herself as 'sophisticated' once he/she has made at least two investments in investment-based crowdfunding.How are the new Rules different?The new regulations for investment-based crowdfunding make sure that investors don't get undue exposure and at the same time there is a scope for increasing exposures in incremental phase by following a learning curve.The definition of a 'sophisticated' investor is not just restricted to the net worth but also takes in consideration the experience and the confidence that an investor has in such investments.Disclosures by the investors play a very crucial role.6.4.6 FranceThe old regulations in France allowed a company to raise up to $ 1,40,000 for equity. This amount has been raised to $ 14,00,000. But there is no maximum investment cap specified for a particular investor, which makes the investors decide on their risk appetite.The new laws allows platforms to register as a crowdfunding investment advisor, which will enable platforms to get paid by companies as well as the investors.Like US, France has also brought in the concept of accredited investors. Previously, the companies were only able to give the complete information (valuation, dates, percent of ownership, etc.) concerning their fundraising to 150 potential investors. The new rules have done away with that cap, allowing for an unlimited number of investors to pitch in cash.Page 16 of 66The need for an external audit is done away, but there is a huge impetus on extensive disclosures by issuers both at the time of fund raising and periodically.Companies will also be allowed to take loans from individuals for a total of up to 1 million, though the loan amount is capped at 1,000 per investor per company.6.4.7 JapanFinancial Services Agency (FSA), Japan has promulgated an amendment in Financial Instruments and Exchange Act on May 23, 2014 to facilitate and promote, inter alia, Equity Crowdfunding in Japan.The amendments pertinent to Crowdfunding are given as under:I. Relaxation of entry requirements of Financial\tInstruments BusinessOperators (FIBO).(FIBO: An entity allowed to engage in the activities of trading, intermediation, brokerage, undertaking in primary and secondary public offerings, and other businesses involving only the securities which they are authorized for.)Revised Regulations:Relaxation of Entry Requirementso\tRestrictions on the conduct of other businesses would not be imposed on crowdfunding platform operators that handle only 'small amounts' and the minimum capital required for registration would be reduced7 .o\t'small amounts' mean that the total amount offered is less than 100 million yen and the amount of investment per person is 500,00 yen or less.Establishment of Rules to protect Investorso\tTo prevent fraudulent behavior, crowdfunding platform operators would be obligated to conduct checks on the businesses of the start-ups and to provide information of issuers, etc. appropriately through the Internet.7 Type I FIBO: 50 million yen (current) reduced to 10 million yen, Type II FIBO: 10 million yen (current) reduced to 5 million yenPage 17 of 667.0 Indian Scenario7.1. Existing Legal Framework7.1.1 The provisions in the existing legal framework for raising funds by companies are regulated under Companies' Act 2013 and Securities Act i.e. SEBI Act, 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, Depositories Act, 1996. Raising of pooled managed investment funds by various entities such as Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), Mutual Fund (MF) etc. is regulated under Securities Laws.7.2. Public Issue of Securities by Companies7.2.1 Companies making public issue of securities need to comply with public issue requirements prescribed in Companies Act, 2013 and Rules made thereunder, apart from the requirements of SEBI Regulations.7.2.2 Companies Act requires a company proposing to make a public issue to make a listing application to recognized stock exchanges. It requires the issuing company to file a Prospectus with Registrar of Companies. Further, detailed disclosure requirements for Prospectus are also specified.7.2.3 Under Section 24 of the Companies Act, 2013, the provisions relating to issue and transfer of securities by listed companies or those companies which intend to get their securities listed on any recognized stock exchange in India shall be administered by SEBI. Hence, SEBI regulates public issuance of securities and those private placements which are proposed to be listed on stock exchange(s).7.2.4 SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (ICDR) requires issuers making public issue of specified securities to comply with requirements prescribed there-in which includes appointment of merchant banker, registrar to issue, filing of draft offer document with SEBI, eligibility requirement such as track record, minimum promoters contribution, lock-in requirements, requirement to have a monitoring agency, etc., apart from detailed disclosure requirements.Page 18 of 667.2.5 However, in case of debt securities, there is a simpler regime and the issuer need to comply with SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 (ILDS), which requires compliance with basic requirements like having a Debenture trustee, Credit Rating, disclosure requirements, etc.Further, once securities are listed in a Recognized Stock Exchange, the issuer has to comply with the continuous listing requirements.7.3. Private Placements of Securities by Companies7.3.1 Taking into account the recent misuse of private placement route by some companies which issued huge number of debt securities to public under the garb of private placements, Companies Act, 2013 and Rules made thereunder, have put some restrictions on private placements, which was previously lightly regulated.7.3.2 As per Chapter III - The Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 , in case of a private placement of securities, private placement offer or invitation cannot be made to more than 200 persons in the aggregate in a financial year (excluding Qualified Institutional Buyers and employees of the company being offered securities under a scheme of employees stock option).7.3.3 Such offer can be made only to such persons whose names are recorded by the company prior to the invitation to subscribe, and that such persons shall receive the offer by name, and that a complete record of such offers shall be kept by the company and complete information about such offer shall be filed with the Registrar within a period of thirty days of circulation of relevant private placement offer letter.7.3.4 All monies payable towards subscription of securities through private placement shall be paid through cheque or demand draft or other banking channels but not by cash. Further, rules require that the payment to be made for subscription to securities shall be made from the bank account of the person subscribing to such securities and the company shall keep a record of all such bank accounts. The company shall allot itsPage 19 of 66securities within sixty days from the date of receipt of the application money for private placement, else money has to be repaid to the investors.7.3.5 Company offering securities through private placement shall not release any public advertisements or utilize any media, marketing or distribution channels or agents to inform the public at large about such an offer.7.3.6 Ministry of Corporate Affairs has also notified Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014. As per the said Rules, a private placement offer letter shall be accompanied by an application form serially numbered and addressed specifically to the person to whom the offer is made and no person other than the person so addressed in the application form shall be allowed to apply through such application form. The value of such offer or invitation per person shall be with an investment size of not less than Rs.20,000 of face value of the securities.7.3.7 A return of allotment of securities shall be filed with Registrar of Companies within 30 days of allotment along with a complete list of all security holders containing the full name, address, Permanent Account Number and E-mail ID of such security holder.7.3.8 Companies Act, 2013 mentions that any offer or invitation that is not in compliance with the provisions of Section 42 shall be treated as a public offer and all provisions of Companies Act, 2013, and the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 shall be required to be complied with, including the above mentioned requirements.7.3.9 However, as mentioned above, Companies Act, 2013 provides a window for making private placement offers to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) and the 'limit of 200' is not applicable to such QIBs. QIBs are the entities such as a MF, Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI), AIF, Scheduled Commercial Bank, IRDA registered Insurance company etc. as defined in SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009.Page 20 of 667.4. Provisions regarding SME Funding7.4.1 SEBI has taken various steps in the recent past to enable Start-ups and SME to raise funds through various routes such as SME Segment of Exchanges, Institutional Trading Platform (ITP), Category I- SME Fund under AIF Regulations. These channels are briefly defined in the following sections:7.4.2 SME Segment7.4.2.1 SEBI has specified framework for a SME segment (platform) on Recognized Stock Exchanges, where Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) can list their securities. A company which has its post-issue face value capital not exceeding ten crore rupees shall list only in SME platform. A company, which has its post issue face value capital more than ten crore rupees and upto twenty five crore rupees, has an option to list in SME platform. In case the post-issue face value capital exceeds Rupees twenty five crore rupees, the issuer should compulsorily list only on main board of the Stock Exchanges.7.4.2.2 However, a listed issuer whose post-issue face value capital is less than twenty five crore rupees may migrate to SME platform if its shareholders approve such migration by passing a special resolution through postal ballot. An issuer listed on SME exchange proposing to issue further capital pursuant to which their post-issue face value capital may increase beyond Rs. 25 crore shall migrate to the main board, subject to obtaining in-principle approval of the main board before issue of such securities.7.4.2.3 Various relaxations have been provided to SMEs listing on SME segment under SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009. Some of them are:Draft Offer document may be filed directly with the exchange and not necessarily with SEBI.Eligibility criteria for an issuer under Regulation 26 is not applicable to companies listing under SME segment.Page 21 of 66Minimum application value of Rs.5000-7000 is not applicable (min. application value shall not be less than Rs. one lakh per application).Minimum number of prospective allottees is fifty (instead of 1,000 in Main board).7.4.2.4 Similarly, relaxations have also been provided with respect to the continuous listing requirements for Companies listed in SMEs:Requirement to file half yearly financial results instead of quarterlyExemption from publishing financial results in newspaperSME companies may send abridged annual report to their shareholders. However, the same need to be displayed on the website of the exchange and company.7.4.2.5 Apart from the above, there is a compulsory market making requirement for companies listed on SME segment for a minimum period of three years from the date of listing to ensure liquidity in the market.7.4.2.6 SME Segments were launched on BSE and NSE on December 14, 2012 and September 18, 2012 respectively. There are 60 SMEs listed on the BSE SME Exchange and 5 SMEs listed on the NSE SME Exchange (Emerge) as on June 11, 2014.7.4.3 Institutional Trading Platform (ITP)7.4.3.1 SEBI has permitted listing of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), including start-up companies, on the SME exchange Institutional Trading Platform (ITP), without being required to make an initial public offer. The main features of the ITP Platform following are:Only such SMEs which do not have their securities listed on any recognized stock exchange are permitted to list their specified securities exclusively on the ITP.The listing process of ITP does not involve an IPO, or private placement or any issue of securities.Page 22 of 66While such companies are listed on the platform, they are not permitted to raise capital.Since the trading lot has been mandated as 10 lakh, participation in this platform is restricted to informed investors.The companies listed in ITP are SMEs and start-up companies which get visibility by listing in the stock exchanges, without any public issue of their securities.The regulatory framework for ITP also envisages that the SMEs listed in this platform will mandatorily exit the platform if (a) a period of 10 years have elapsed since the company was listed in the ITP (b) the paid-up capital of the company is more than twenty five crore rupees (c) the revenue of the company is more than three hundred crore rupees (d) company reaches market capitalization of more than five hundred crore rupees.7.4.3.2 This platform is merely meant to provide the initial impetus for such SMEs rather than a sustained listing over a long term horizon.7.4.3.3 In addition to the visibility to SMEs, this framework also provides a trading platform for the scrips of Start-up Companies held by Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), VCFs etc. and enhances the liquidity in such scrips, which in-turn provide enabling environment for SME and start-up enterprises to flourish.BSE launched its ITP on February 11, 2014. There are 6 companies listed on ITP of BSE. NSE launched its ITP on October 28, 2013 and there is 1 company listed on it as on June 11, 2014.7.5. Provisions related to Alternative Investment Funds:7.5.1 SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations (VCF Regulations) were framed in 1996 to encourage funding by entrepreneurs early-stage companies in India. However, since registration of VCF was not mandatory under VCF Regulations, all players in the alternative funds industry were not registered with SEBI. Hence, it was felt that there was a regulatory gap which needed to be addressed. Further, SEBI Board hadPage 23 of 66approved the proposal for a clear regulatory framework for privately pooled investment vehicles under AIF framework to inter-alia pave way for increased investment in startups, SMEs, etc. and also provide for a mechanism to monitor and assess systemic risks and risks to financial market stability posed by the activities of some funds such as Hedge funds.7.5.2 Considering the same, SEBI notified the framework for registering and regulating Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) through SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 on May 21, 2012.7.5.3 These Regulations cover all privately pooled investment vehicles in India raising funds from Indian or foreign investors for investing in accordance with a defined investment policy for the benefit of its investors. However, Mutual Funds, Collective Investment Schemes, Family Trusts, Employee Welfare trusts, Securitization trusts, any other funds regulated by other regulators, etc. are exempted from the ambit of the AIF Regulations.7.5.4 These regulations seek to cover the funds broadly under 3 categories.Category I  which includes Venture Capital Funds, SME Funds, Social Venture Funds, Infrastructure Fund, etc. (which invests in sectors or areas which the government or regulators may consider as socially or economically desirable);Category II  which includes private equity funds or debt funds (which does not undertake leverage or borrowing other than to meet day-to-day operational requirements) andCategory III  which includes Hedge Funds - (employ leverage including through investment in derivatives)7.5.5\tAs per the said Regulations, AIF should be prohibited by its trustdeed/memorandum and articles of association/partnership deed from making an invitation to the public to subscribe to its securities. AIF shall not accept from an investor an investment of value less than Rs. 1 Crore and no scheme of the AIF shall have morePage 24 of 66than 1,000 investors. Further, each scheme of the AIF shall have a minimum corpus of Rs. 20 crore. Further, the manager or sponsor shall have a continuing interest in the AIF of certain percentage of the corpus.7.5.6 Category I AIFs are further categorized in 4 sub-categories: (i) Venture Capital Funds (ii) Social Venture Funds, (iii) SME Funds, (iv) Infrastructure Funds.i.\tSocial Venture Funds:An AIF which invests primarily in securities or units of social ventures and which satisfies social performance norms laid down by the fund and whose investors may agree to receive restricted or muted returns may get itself registered as a Social Venture Fund under SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012. It can accept investment which is not less than one crore and such investor may accept muted returns. Such funds are also entitled to accept grants, provided that utilization of such grants shall be restricted to social ventures. Further, the amount of grants that may be accepted by the fund from any person shall not be less than Rs. 25 Lakhs and no profits or gains shall accrue to the provider of such grants.There are 3 Social Venture Funds registered with SEBI with a corpus of Rs. 820-900 Crores as on June 11, 2014.ii.\tSME Funds:An investment fund which invests primarily in unlisted securities of investee companies which are SMEs or securities of those SMEs which are listed or proposed to be listed on a SME exchange or SME segment of an exchange may get itself registered as an SME Fund. Such funds:shall invest at least 75% of the investible funds in unlisted securities or partnership interest of venture capital undertakings or investee companies which are SMEs or in companies listed or proposed to be listed on SME exchange or SME segment of an exchangemay enter into an agreement with merchant banker to subscribe to the unsubscribed portion of the issue or to receive or deliver securities in the processPage 25 of 66of market making under Chapter XB of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009There are 5 SME funds registered with SEBI with corpus in the range of Rs. 1,625 - 2,125 Crores as on June 11, 2014.iii.\tAngel Funds:Under SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012, a sub-category has been created under Category I  Venture Capital Funds called Angel Funds vide amendment dated September 16, 2013. Such funds can raise funds from angel investors and make investments in start-ups/early stage companies.In order to ensure that investment by such angel funds is genuine 'angel investment' in India, it is prescribed that the investee companies:a. are incorporated in India and are not more than 3 years old; andb. have a turnover not exceeding Rs 25 crore; andc. are unlisted, andd. are not promoted, sponsored or related to an Industrial Group whose group turnover is in excess of Rs. 300 crore, ande. has no family connection with the investors proposing to invest in the company.Investment in an investee company by an angel fund shall not be less than Rs. 50 lakhs and more than Rs. 5 crore. Such conditions are expected to ensure that the investments are genuine investments in start-ups/ early stage companies in India.Minimum Corpus of an Angel Fund shall be Rs.10 Crores. Minimum investment from each investor shall be Rs. 25 Lakhs. As Angel investments are highly risky investments, necessary restrictions are imposed on the eligibility of the investors in order to ensure that only investors who have prior experience/ adequate awareness of such investments and who have sufficient capital invest in such funds. Reduced mandatory minimum sponsor/manager contribution is made applicable to Angel Funds comparing to other AIFs, i.e. 2.5% of the corpus/ Rs. 50 lakhs, whichever is lesser.Page 26 of 66There is 1 Angel Fund registered with SEBI as on June 11, 2014.8.0 Is Crowdfunding really needed ?8.1 As mentioned earlier, the 2008 financial crisis resulted in failure of number of Banks and, consequently, the new capital adequacy regulations for banks, such as Basel III were implemented. As a result, credit providers have become increasingly constrained in their ability to lend money to the real economy.8.2 IOSCO Paper states that the amount of bank loans made in Western Europe and the USA dropped significantly at the beginning of the crisis. While there have been some signs of recovery in the US (although the growth rate is still below pre-crisis levels), in Western Europe the growth rate in loans to the non-financial corporate sector has been negative, especially to SMEs in the EU. In this funding vacuum, peer-to-peer lending and other Crowdfunding Platforms are growing in popularity, as bank liquidity is reduced and new regulatory requirements make obtaining loans for small and medium enterprises and individuals difficult.8.3 In India, during the last few years, the IPO market has not been very active. Though, SEBI, has been at the forefront in facilitating fund raising by SMEs through measures like SME segment in Stock Exchanges, Category I- SME funds under AIF, Institutional Trading Platform, etc., still there is need to encourage innovative way of fund raising to provide an impetus to genuine SMEs/Start-ups and to explore other alternative models of fund raising with appropriate framework in consonance with retail investor protection.8.4 Since the \"Crowdfunding\" phenomenon is gaining its popularity, its importance cannot be ignored. To regulate crowdfunding, it is very important to take note that while it is necessary to ensure that Start-ups/SMEs could raise funds at ease, it is equally important to ensure that no systemic risks are created wherein retail investors are lured by some unscrupulous players by substituting the existing framework, which has been developed over a period of time through experience and observation. Hence, there isPage 27 of 66necessity to strike a proper balance between investor protection and the role equity markets can play in supporting economic development and growth.8.5 While some regulators are criticized by media from taking the crowd out of crowdfunding',8 there are also media reports explaining the risks in the model and stating that regulators who are today denounced for their intervention will then be castigated for their neglect.98.6 IOSCO Paper states that \"A risk posed by moving to regulate a previously exempt sector is the perceived rubber stamping of the industry through regulation, creating credibility in the peer-to-peer lending and equity crowd-funding markets.This could attract less experienced investors to these markets who may not understand the risks involved in these types of investment.8.7 Therefore it would be appropriate for regulators to take appropriate stand in this regard and send out a message to the various stakeholders recognizing this emerging route of funding. India, so far, does not face a significant exposure to crowdfunding but given that this mode of fund raising is growing at a scorching pace, it is important that regulators keep an open eye and a vigilant attitude.Question 1: Given that Crowdfunding is still in nascent stages and most of the jurisdictions around the world have taken a guarded view by allowing it in a restricted manner, do you think India is ready for crowdfunding or is it premature to introduce such risky investment channel ?8http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/06/crowdfunding-regulator-10-percent-rule9http://www.johnkay.com/2014/03/25/regulators-will-get-the-blame-for-the-stupidity-of-crowdsPage 28 of 669.0\tProposal for Crowdfunding in India9.0.1 SEBI has provided various frameworks for raising of funds by startups, SMEs etc. as specified in the paragraph 7. In addition to the available frameworks, SEBI seeks to provide fresh avenues for startups and SMEs set up by young entrepreneurs and technology professionals to raise early stage funding through internet based platforms, potentially more efficiently and cost effectively than through public issue or private placement offering.9.0.2 Crowdfunding is an innovative way to provide modest amount of funding to young entrepreneurs and technology professionals needing early stage or seed capital for startup companies which may spur entrepreneurship and ultimately assist in boosting the growth of real economy.9.0.3 A company raising funds through online crowdfunding platforms or websites offers equity or debt interests in its business to investors who make small contributions, through a crowdfunding platform or social media. In most of the cases funding is sought online on the basis of future projections rather than a viable business model in operation which increases the risk of failures and therefore loss to the investors.9.0.4 If the costs associated with regulatory provisions for investor protection are excessive, crowdfunding may not become a viable capital raising method. At the same time investors would be concerned about the risks of crowdfunding and may not be prepared to invest if there are no adequate safeguards in place. Therefore the proposal seeks to strike a balance between retail investor protection and capital market access to such ventures by providing adequate investor safeguard without creating too many entry barriers or significant regulatory burdens on the issuers.9.0.5 Pure Donation Based Crowdfunding (where issuers directly seek donation from the grantors), Reward Based Crowdfunding (where issuers directly offers rewards like movie tickets, new computer game, download of a book etc.) and Peer-to-Peer lending do not fall within the regulatory purview of SEBI, as they do not generally involvePage 29 of 66issuance of securities for financial return, and may require authorization from other regulators. For example, Peer-to-Peer lending may fall under the purview of RBI.9.0.6 Taking into account various provisions under the Indian law and crowdfunding framework in other jurisdictions, this proposal seeks to explore the possibilities of having Security Based Crowdfunding framework in India within the existing legal framework.9.0.7 Crowdfunding is intended to facilitate raising of modest amount by startups and SMEs for early stage funding and it is not necessary or appropriate to allow certain complex or hybrid products. Under the Security Based Crowdfunding, the possible routes which are being explored are as follows:1. Equity based Crowdfunding (EbC)2. Debt based Crowdfunding (DbC)3. Fund based Crowdfunding (FbC)9.0.8 In all the approaches, the Crowdfunding Platform plays a central role where investors can meet promising start up companies. The web based crowdfunding platform will facilitate raising of capital through its website from investors who have access to such platform. The first 2 routes are primarily based on the Private Placement route as defined under Section 42, Companies Act 2013. The FbC route is primarily modeled on SEBI (AIF) Regulations, 2012.9.0.9 Before dealing with these routes it is important that the following are established:the investors that are allowed to invest through the crowdfunding platforms,the types of entities that are allowed to raise funds through this channel and the disclosure requirements,the types of entities that are allowed to set up internet based Crowdfunding Platforms to enable online solicitation from such investors,and the different associated aspects.Page 30 of 669.1 Who can be the Investor?9.1.1 Various jurisdictions have imposed different restrictions on investments andcategories of investors who are allowed to invest in companies which are displayed on such internet based crowdfunding websites or platforms, such as:Jurisdiction\tLimitations on Investment under CrowdfundingUSA\tIn a 12 month period, investors are allowed to invest$2,000 or 5 percent of their annual income or net worth, whichever is greater, if both their annual income and net worth are less than $100,000.10 percent of their annual income or net worth, whichever is greater, if either their annual income or net worth is equal to or more than $100,000.UK\t\tNo limit for investors advised by professionals, linked to corporate finance or venture capital firms, or those certified as sophisticated or high net worth.Not more than 10% of assets - excluding homes and pensions, for other investors.Australia\tOne\tof the\toption\tproposed\tis\tthat the\tinvestor\tneeds\tto\tbesophisticated i.e. have assets of worth at least $ 2.5 million or have a gross income of at least $ 250,000 for each of the last 2 financial years.France\t1,000 per campaignCanada\tA maximum of $2,500 in a single investment and $10,000 per year9.1.2 It is necessary that the investors who seek to invest in crowdfunding understand the inherent risks involved in the speculative nature of start-up companies and illiquid nature of their securities and can bear the loss of the entire investment.9.1.3 In Indian scenario, considering the necessity to provide alternative funding sources to Start-ups and at the same time to ensure that retail investors are not made to bearPage 31 of 66the risks of Start-up ventures, it is proposed to permit only Accredited Investors to participate in crowdfunding.9.1.4 The Accredited Investors:9.1.4.1 The proposed accredited investors who may be allowed to invest throughcrowdfunding platforms are as under:Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) as defined in SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) regulations, 2009 as amended from time to time,Companies incorporated under the Companies Act of India, with a minimum net worth10 of Rs. 20 Crore,High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) with a minimum net worth Rs. 2 Crores or more (excluding the value of the primary residence or any loan secured on such property), andEligible Retail Investors (ERIs):o\twho receive investment advice from an Investment Adviser, oro\twho avail services of a Portfolio manager, oro\twho have passed an Appropriateness Test (may be conducted by aninstitution accredited by NISM or the crowdfunding platforms),ando\twho have a minimum annual gross income of Rs. 10 Lacs,o\twho have filed Income Tax return for at least last 3 financial years,o\twho certify that they will not invest more than Rs. 60,000 in an issue through crowdfunding platform,o\twho certify that they will not invest more than 10% of their net worth through crowdfunding. (Net worth excludes the value of the primary residence or any loan secured on such property).9.1.4.2 Thus those retail investors who have knowledge, experience or have access to investment advice and have resources to cope with the losses on their investments in a10 Net Worth is calculated as the aggregate value of paid up equity capital plus free reserves (excluding reserves created out of revaluation) reduced by the aggregate value of accumulated losses and deferred expenditure not written off, including miscellaneous expenses not written off.Page 32 of 66start up, are eligible to invest as ERI in crowdfunding and come within the category of accredited investors.Question 2: Are the Accredited Investors mentioned in paragraph 9.1.4 suitable to participate in the risky investments of crowdfunding? Is there a need to expand or reduce the categories of investors or expand or reduce safeguards? Specify along with the rationale.9.1.5 Investment Limits:9.1.5.1 Chapter III - The Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 specifies that in case of a private placement of securities the offer or invitation to subscribe shall not be made to more than 200 investors in a financial year. Any offer or invitation made to QIBs or to employees of the company under a scheme of employees stock option shall not be considered while calculating the limit of 200 persons.Therefore, EbC and DbC shall allow private placement offers through internet based crowdfunding platforms to any number of QIBs and a maximum of 200 HNIs and ERIs combined.9.1.5.2 In some jurisdictions, e.g.in Italy professional investors must own at least 5% of the equity in a crowdfunded venture. The apparent intention is to give some form of comfort to retail investors that the issuer is genuine as one or more sophisticated investors have chosen to invest. It is therefore proposed that QIBs, Companies and HNIs should be required to own at least a certain percentage in every issue through EbC and DbC.9.1.5.3 Chapter III - The Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 specifies that in case of a private placement of securities, the minimum offer value per person must be at least Rs. 20,000 of the face value of the securities. In view of the above, we propose that:Page 33 of 66A QIB is required to purchase at least 5 times of the minimum offer value per person as specified in the aforementioned rule. Collectively all the QIBs shall hold a minimum of 5% of the securities issued.A Company is required to purchase at least 4 times of the minimum offer value per person as specified in the aforementioned rule.A HNI is required to purchase at least 3 times the minimum offer value per person.An ERI is required to purchase at least the minimum offer value per person. The maximum investment by an ERI in an issue shall not exceed Rs. 60,000. The total of all investments in crowdfunding for an eligible retail investor in a year should not exceed 10% of its net worth.Question 3: Are the Investment Limits specified in paragraph 9.1.5 justifiable with respect to the respective investor classes? Are they too high or too low? Specify along with rationale.Question 4: Is the limit of investors upto 200 besides QIBs or employees of the company under a scheme of employees stock option, as specified in Chapter III - The Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014, adequate or is there a need to amend such rules to allow upto 1,000 investors, excluding QIBs or employees of the company under a scheme of employees stock option?9.1.6 Investment Conditions:The ERIs and HNIs must sign a 'Risk Acknowledgement' that they understand the risk of illiquid nature of investment and potential loss of entire investment, and that they can bear the loss.The issue has to be in Demat form thus all the accredited investors need to hold a demat account.The payment has to be made through a cheque or a demand draft or another banking channel. Payment by Cash and Credit Cards shall not be accepted.The ERIs must be an Indian citizen / NRI.ERIs must fulfill the eligibility requirements as specified in the paragraph 9.1.4.1.Page 34 of 66Investments by foreign investors shall, however, be subject to guidelines as may be specified by RBI and government of India from time to time.Question 5: Are the Investment Conditions mentioned in the paragraph 9.1.6 enough to warn and guard investors regarding the risky nature of crowdfunding? Specify changes, if any, along with the rationale.9.2 Who can raise funds from Crowdfunding Platform and Limitations on capitalraised?9.2.1 Crowdfunding is intended to solve the funding problems of early stage startups andSMEs. The existing various sources of funding through capital markets for startups and SMEs in India have been summarized in paragraph 7.9.2.2 As crowdfunding shall entail substitution or relaxation of requirements of prospectus or listing etc. various jurisdictions have imposed different set of limitations on the amount allowed to be raised through online crowdfunding platforms and the conditions to be satisfied by the issuing companies. Some of these are listed as under:Jurisdiction\tLimitation on capital RaisedUSA\t$1,000,000 in a period of 12 monthsUK\t2.5 million in a period of 12 monthsNew Zealand\tNZ$2 million from 20 investors in any 12 month periodAustralia\tNot more than $2 million or transfer equity to more than 20 people in a 12 month periodFrance\t1m (827,951) per campaign per yearCanada\t$1.5 million over one year9.2.3 Some jurisdictions have also imposed restrictions on the nature of companies which can raise capital from such crowdfunding platforms, e.g. in Italy crowdfunding is restricted only to innovative startups. To be innovative a firm must be recognized asPage 35 of 66such by the Chamber of Commerce and to be startup a firm can be no more than 48 months in existence.9.2.4 Crowdfunding can provide an alternative source of capital for startups and SMEs that either have limited access to capital or have exhausted other available sources of capital. It is, therefore, proposed that the additional channel of crowdfunding platform to raise modest amount of funds is allowed to be accessed by early stage startup or SME which is an unlisted public company incorporated in India, under EbC or DbC routes as mentioned in paragraph 9.4, provided it is:a company intending to raise capital not exceeding Rs. 10 Crores in a period of 12 months. Companies which intend to make issue more than size of Rs.10 Crores may raise funds by complying with the provisions of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations and list them on a SME Platform or main board of a recognized stock exchange,a company which is not promoted, sponsored or related to an industrial group which has a turnover in excess of Rs. 25 Crores or has an established business,a company which is not listed on any exchange,a company which is not more than 48 months old,a company which proposes to engage in non-financing ventures, i.e. funds raised through the crowdfunding platform will not be further used for providing loans or investments in other entities, anda company which is not engaged in real estate and activities which are not permitted under industrial policy of Government of India.9.2.5 Further, to ensure only genuine entities raise funds through this mode:The issuing company, its directors, promoters or associates have not been prohibited from accessing or operating in the capital markets or restrained from buying, selling or dealing in securities under any order or direction passed by the SEBI.The issuing company, its directors, promoters or associates are not mentioned as a 'defaulter' or a 'wilful defaulter' by RBI or CIBIL.The director(s) or promoter(s) are not disqualified to be appointed as director(s) under the Companies Act 2013.Page 36 of 66The issuing company, its directors, promoters or associates are 'fit and proper' persons as specified under the Schedule II of the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008.9.2.6 In addition to above, the issuers must also comply with the following:In a given period of 12 months, Issuers shall not use multiple crowdfunding platforms to raise funds.Issuers shall not directly or indirectly advertise their offering to public in general or solicit investments from the public.Issuer shall compulsorily route all crowdfunding issues through a SEBI recognized Crowdfunding Platform.Issuers shall not directly or indirectly incentivize or compensate any person to promote its offering.Issuers shall provide provisions for oversubscription. This may include maximum oversubscription amount to be retained, which should not exceed 25% of the actual issue size; intended usage of the oversubscribed amount. The total amount retained. including the actual issue size and oversubscription, shall not exceed the limit of Rs. 10 Crores.Question 6: Given that the companies coming for crowdfunding lack any significant track record, are the conditions and requirements mentioned in paragraph 9.2 enough to fend off fraudulent issuers? Specify changes, if any, along with the rationale.9.3 Disclosure Requirements on Issuer9.3.1 It is proposed that Crowdfunding follow a disclosure based regime. It is veryimportant that the companies seeking to raise funds through crowdfunding disclose true and factual information to facilitate investors in an informed decision making. The disclosures are required (i) when an issuer approaches the crowdfunding platform with the intention of raising funds from the accredited investors registered with the platform, and (ii) at regular intervals on an ongoing basis.Page 37 of 669.3.2 Though different jurisdictions have specified different set of disclosures for the issuers, the basic spirit behind this is to enable the investors to make an informed decision regarding their investments and to keep a track of the growth of their investments on a continuing basis. The disclosure requirements in different jurisdictions are as follows:Jurisdiction\tRequired disclosuresThe name, legal status, physical address and Web site address of the issuer;The names of the directors and officers (and any persons occupying a similar status or performing a similar function), and each person holding more than 20 percent of the shares of the issuer;a description of the business of the issuer and the anticipated business plan of the issuer;a description of the financial condition of the issuer83;a description of the stated purpose and intended use of the proceeds of the offering sought by the issuer with respect to the target offering amount;statement on excess investment;USAdescription on other offerings, related party transactions and financial condition;the target offering amount, the deadline to reach the target offering amount and regular updates regarding the progress of the issuer in meeting the target offering amount;intermediary identification and compensation;the price to the public of the securities or the method for determining the price; anda description of the ownership and capital structure of the issuer.In addition, Section 4A(b)(1)(I) specifies that the Commission may require additional disclosures for the protection of investors and in the public interest.Page 38 of 66UK\tInvestors should be presented with information that is \"fair, clear and not misleading\" when deciding whether or not to make an investment. No specific disclosures mandated by the regulator.New\tIssuers making Crowd Sourced Equity Funding(CSEF) offers through licensed CSEF intermediaries will be exempt from the normal requirements to register a product disclosure document.ZealandFrance\tA document with information concerning the company, its activities and its financial situation.Canada\t\tDetailed business planDisclosure of the issuers cash with third party confirmation if the issuer has not incurred any expenditures and its only asset is cash; orAnnual financial statements if the issuer has incurred expenditures; orAudited annual financial statements if the issuer has raised more than $500,000 under the crowdfunding prospectus exemption or any other prospectus exemption since its formation and has expended more than $150,000 since that time.9.3.3 Though the disclosures may not be as elaborate as IPO disclosures, which would increase the cost of compliance, some basic details of the company need to be provided. Therefore it is proposed that, a company intending to raise funds through crowdfunding platform submit an Private Placement Offer Letter to the Crowdfunding Portal, which inter alia may contain the following:i.\tName of the company & Registered office addressii.\tA description of the current/new venture for which the funds are being raised (Anticipated Business Plan)iii.\tIssue Size and specified target offering amount and intended usage of fundsiv.\tA description on the valuation of securities offeredv.\tPast history of funding, if anyvi.\tHistory of any prior refusal from any Crowdfunding PlatformPage 39 of 66vii.\tA description of financial condition of the company including Audited financial statements of 1 year, if any (Balance sheet, Profit and Loss Account, Cash Flow Statements)viii.\tPrice of securities offered and the rights and liabilities attaching to the securitiesix.\tOwnership details and capital structurex.\tDetails regarding Board, Management and Group entities, persons with a shareholding of 20% or more, etc.,xi.\tPrincipal risks to the issuer's businessxii.\tGrievance redressal and Dispute resolution mechanism, such as arbitration mechanismxiii.\tSuch other information as SEBI may specify9.3.4 The Private Placement Offer Letter submitted by the issuer shall be circulated online only to those selected accredited investors who are registered with the crowdfunding platform and have made a commitment, not numbering more than 200, and excluding QIBs.Question 7: Are the disclosure requirements for a company interested in raising funds through crowdfunding platform mentioned in paragraph 9.3.3, enough to enable investors in an informed decision making ? Specify changes, if any, along with the rationale.9.3.5 Though future projections are not allowed in offer document of a public issue, but in crowdfunding, owing to the lack of any meaningful business history or financial track record, decision making is significantly based on the future projections made by the issuer. So it becomes important that a realistic view into the future growth path of the issuer is provided to the prospective investors. These projections should be based on some trusted third party research and realistic assumptions.Question 8: Due to the lack of history and track record, it is important that the issuers provide future projections of their business to facilitate investors inPage 40 of 66decision making. What should be the criteria to ensure that the projections are realistic and achievable and not misguiding in nature?9.3.6 The issuing companies shall also be required to submit information on an ongoing basis. It is proposed that the issuing companies submit biannual disclosures to the Crowdfunding Platform, which inter alia may contain the following:i.\tAudited financial statements (Balance sheet, Profit & Loss statement, Cash flow statement etc.)ii.\tUtilization of funds raised in accordance to the object of the issue as specified at the time of the issueiii.\tA detailed view of the current state of business and the progress made since last disclosureiv.\tAny other funding raised since the last disclosurev.\tAny penalty, pending litigation or regulatory action against the company or promoter(s) or director(s)9.3.7 Such ongoing disclosures shall be displayed by the platform on its website and will be available to accredited investors who are registered with such platform.Question 9: What should be the continuous disclosure requirements for a company once it gets displayed on the platform? How it should be ensured that there is no information asymmetry between various prospective investors?9.4 Who can set up a Crowdfunding Platform?9.4.1 It is necessary that crowdfunding platforms are not established or not used tofacilitate fund raising by fraudulent entities. It is therefore important to specify integrity, experience and solvency requirements applicable to crowdfunding platform owner and the key persons associated with it. Therefore it is proposed that any online offering or issue or sale through the internet can be made only through a SEBI recognized crowdfunding platform.9.4.2 If it is intended to develop a framework for Crowdfunding Platform, the criteria for eligibility or recognition need to be specified.Page 41 of 669.4.3 The entities who can set up a crowdfunding platform or website and their roles and responsibilities in different jurisdictions are as follows:Jurisdiction Roles and Responsibilities of Crowdfunding PlatformUSA\tIf the online platform just lists an entrepreneurs or companys pitch, usesa third party to manage the transfer of both cash and stock, and offers general support services that dont fall into these categories of activities, it can register as a crowdfund investment portal. If it conducts any of these activities, it must register as a full broker-dealer.It has the following responsibilities:directors, officers or partners (or any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function) are prohibited from having any financial interest in an issuer using its servicesrequired to take steps to reduce the risk of fraud by obtaining a background and securities enforcement regulatory history check on each officer, director, and person holding more than 20 percent of the outstanding equity of every issuer whose securities are offered by such intermediaryIntermediary and its associated persons prohibited from accepting an investment commitment unless the investor has opened an account with the intermediary and the intermediary has obtained from the investor consent to electronic delivery of materialsIntermediary required to deliver to the investors educational materials at the time of account openingIntermediary required to disclose its compensation structure to the investorIntermediary required to make issuers' information available at least 21 days prior to the issueIntermediary to ensure that an investor's investment limit is not breached before it makes an investmentIntermediary to provide communication channels on its website forPage 42 of 66investors to connect amongst themselves as well as for an investor to connect to an issuerIntermediary to ensure that all proceeds are only provided to the issuer when the aggregate capital raised from all investors is equal to or greater than a target offering amount, in case it is a broker. In case of funding portal, since it cannot receive funds, it would direct the funds to a qualified third party like bank, which then makes the transfer to the issuer once the proceeds equal or exceed the target amountFunding\tportals\trequired\tto\tmaintain\ta\tfidelity\tbond\tas\tacontingency fundCrowdfunding platforms will be able to make direct offers to retail clients for a period of 12 months so long as the investor signs a RestrictedInvestor Statement.Crowdfunding platforms therefore need to ensure that they (a) include the name of the firm; (b) provide accurate information on the firm and not emphasize potential benefits of the investment without also giving a fairUKindication\tof\tthe\trisks;\t(c)\tpresent\tthe\tinformation\tin\tan\teasilyunderstandable\tway;\tand\t(d)\tnot disguise\tor hide\tany\timportantstatements or warnings.The FCA does not prescribe the level of due diligence which needs to be undertaken by crowdfunding platforms to assess the benefits and risks involved with each particular investment.The provider has fair, orderly, and transparent systems andprocedures for providing the service:The service is designed primarily for offers by persons other thanNew Zealand\tthe provider and its associated persons:The provider has an adequate policy for identifying and managingthe risk of fraud by issuers using the service (the anti-fraud policy) that, at a minimumPage 43 of 66(i) checks, against publicly available and readily accessible information, the identity of the issuer and information provided by the issuer relating to the identity and character of its directors and senior managers; and(ii) excludes an issuer from using the service if the provider(A) is not satisfied as to the identity of the issuer or of the issuer's directors and senior managers; or(B) has reason to believe that any of the issuer's directors or senior managers are not of good character; or(C)has reason to believe that the issuer is not likely to comply with the obligations imposed on it under the serviceThe provider has adequate disclosure arrangements to give investors, or to enable investors to readily obtain, timely and understandable information to assist investors to decide whether to acquire the shares (for example, through initial disclosure, or question and answer forums, or other information that is made available)The provider has an adequate policy (a fair dealing policy) for excluding an issuer from using the service if the provider has information (for example, from checks or assessments it carries out (if any)) that gives it reason to believe that the issuer, in relation to any dealing in shares using the service, has(i) engaged in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive; or(ii) made a false or misleading representation in contravention of section 22 of the Act; or(iii) made an unsubstantiated representation in contravention of section 23 of the Act:Page 44 of 66The\tprovider\thas\tadequate\tsystems\tand\tprocedures\tforimplementing the anti-fraud policy and the fair dealing policy:The provider has adequate systems and procedures for ensuringthat each issuer does not raise more than $2 million in any 12-month period under the service:The provider has adequate systems and procedures for handlingconflicts between the commercial interests of the provider (or of its associated persons) and the need for the provider to have fair, orderly, and transparent systems and procedures for providing the service.If a broking service is to be provided by the provider in the course of providing the service, the provider is, or will be, registered underthe Financial\tService\tProviders\t(Registration\tand\tDisputeResolution)\tAct\t2008 for the\tbroking\tservice\ton\tand\tfromcommencing to provide the broking service.The website operator needs to demonstrate that it has sufficientresources\t(including\tfinancial,\ttechnological\tand\thumanresources)\tand\tadequate\tother\tarrangements\t(includingarrangements for handling of conflicts of interest involving the licensee) to ensure that, to the extent that it is reasonablyAustralia\tpracticable to do so, the market a fair, orderly and transparent.In case, a CSEF (Crowd Sourced Equity Funding)\twebsite ispromoter of a company seeking funds through that website, it can call for additional disclosures like details of any benefits to that promoter.Advertising restrictions on the CSEF website.They are supposed to provide the following services:Non-guaranteed placementFranceOrder receipt-transmission on behalf of third parties (ORT)Order execution on behalf of third partiesPage 45 of 66Operation of a multilateral trading facilityInvestment advicePortals must comply with general registrant requirements applicable toEMDs (with certain exceptions), including minimum capital, insurance, regulatory reporting, record-keeping and record-retention requirements.Portals will be required to:Canada\t\tconduct\tbackground\tchecks\ton\tissuers,\tdirectors,\tofficers,promoters and control persons,understand the general structure, features and risks of a security offered,review the information presented by the issuer on the portal's website to confirm that the information adequately sets out the general features and structure of the security, issuer-specific risks,parties\tinvolved,\tany\tidentified\tconflicts\tof\tinterest,\tand\ttheintended use of funds,deny access to an issuer if it has reason to believe that the issuer or its offering is fraudulent, andprovide investor education materials in plain language and obtaina signed risk acknowledgement form from investors9.4.4 Recognition of Crowdfunding Platform9.4.4.1 It is proposed that the entities who fall in any of the following classes be allowedto set up a crowdfunding platform.9.4.4.2 Class I Entities:Recognized Stock Exchanges with nationwide terminal presence (RSEs)SEBI registered Depositories9.4.4.3 In addition to the entities mentioned above, it is proposed that the another class of entities with relevant experience and domain knowledge be allowed to launchPage 46 of 66crowdfunding platforms to ensure a healthy competition in the market, provided they satisfy the requirements specified by SEBI.9.4.4.4 Class II Entities:Technology Business Incubators(TBIs)o\tpromoted by Central Government or any State Government through bodies such as NSTEDB (National Science & Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board) under Department of Science & Technologyo\tfunctioning as a society registered under societies act of 1860/or as a non-profit making section 8 company,o\thaving at least 5 years of experience,o\thaving a minimum net worth of Rs. 10 Croreso\tshould have attained self-sufficiency and,o\tshould display only those companies which share a common focus thrust areas as the TBI9.4.4.5 A joint venture of a Class I entity and a Class II entity is also acceptable for setting up a Crowdfunding Platform as this would bring the best of both classes.Question 10: While Class I entities are already under SEBI's purview and have a successful track record in securities market, Class II entities have a specialized domain knowledge in the field of start up mentoring and funding. Is a joint venture between the two classes a better idea than to allow them to launch their own crowdfunding platforms separately?Question 11: Any suggestions on some other possible entities which can be included in Class II with a tentative list of qualifying criteria?9.4.4.6 To enable Fund based Crowdfunding (FbC), it is proposed that the new class of Crowd Fund AIFs be allowed to be displayed on the platforms launched by RSEs and depositories. In addition to these platforms, a dedicated class of platform owners isPage 47 of 66proposed to enable FbC launching crowdfunding platforms provided they satisfy the requirements specified by SEBI.9.4.4.7 Class III Entities:Associations and Networks of PE or Angel Investorso\twith a track record of a minimum of 3 yearso\twith a minimum member strength of 100 active members from the relevant industryo\twhich are registered as Section 8 companies under Companies Act 2013 with a paid up share capital of Rs. 2 Crores9.4.4.8 Thus the platforms launched by Class I & Class III Entities can enable the FbC.Question 12: Any suggestions on some other possible candidates which can be included in Class III for the purpose of providing platform for FbC? Also specify their tentative qualifying criteria?9.4.4.8 To prevent fraudulent offering of securities via the internet, it is proposed to provide that no entity can raise funds through crowdfunding without channeling their issues through a recognized Crowdfunding Platform, subject to the approval of Screening Committee.9.4.5 Requirements on Crowdfunding Platform:Taking into consideration the risky nature of securities offered, the Crowdfunding platforms must play the role of a gatekeeper and take reasonable measures to reduce the risk of frauds. This requires adequate capital, technological and human resources to carry out the business in a complying manner. Thus it is proposed that the obligations of such platforms shall be as under:Page 48 of 66to conduct screening and basic due diligence of the business of the start up. However, no amount of due diligence can provide any form of guarantee of the commercial success.to conduct background and regulatory checks on the issuers, whole time directors, promoters, shareholders holding more than 20% of equity shares in the companyreview the information presented by the issuer on the portal's website to confirm that the information adequately sets out the general features and structure of the security, issuer-specific risks, parties involved, any identified conflicts of interest, and the intended use of fundsto conduct due diligence of investors such as net worth requirement and KYC requirement, if any, while maintaining the privacy of the investorsdeny access to an issuer if it has reason to believe that the issuer or its offering is fraudulentmaintain a record of all the issues brought by the companies and subsequently the disclosures of the issuing companies and make it easily accessible to the investorscollect and transmit information to SEBI as may be called forQuestion 13: Any suggestions on some additional or reduced requirements on Crowdfunding Platforms?9.4.6 Further, to ensure a seamless operation and avoid any conflict of interest a Crowdfunding Platform shall also be required to satisfy the following conditions:Platform needs to own the Domain ID/website/URL and mention the same in the application for recognition with SEBI and should have adequate systems and procedures to manage the daily operations as well as the emergency situations.Platform needs to have adequate human, technology and risk management capabilitiesPlatform needs to have fair, orderly and transparent processesPlatform needs to have procedure to address possible conflicts which may arise between issuers and the platformFund raising by subsidiaries/associates or other entities related to the Platform Owners shall not be allowedPage 49 of 66An elaborate contingency/termination plan need to be formulated with minimum impact on the investors, to ensure a seamless operation in the event of closure or financial distress in the crowdfunding platformCrowdfunding platforms shall not offer investment advice, solicit, manage funds or securities, incentivize employees for such sale of securities displayed on the platform or make recommendations to investors.Only accredited investors registered with a crowdfunding platform can invest through that crowdfunding platform. Only Indian start-up companies or SMEs or Crowd Funds can raise funds through these crowdfunding platforms.Platform shall provide a Grievance Redressal mechanism for the investors as well as the issuersThe task of due diligence of the issuing companies is very crucial to differentiate a genuine issuer from a fraud. The due diligence, among other things, will involve track record of the Promoters, Directors, Key Managerial Personnel, business carried on by the company, proposed business plans, Opportunities, Strategies, Litigations, etc.Apart from the basic due diligence, it is important that the platform puts in place some sort of filtering mechanism to differentiate between the quality of ideas and business plans. For this purpose, it is proposed that every crowdfunding platform will have a 'Screening Committee' with a variety of experience from different domains and sectors.9.4.6.1 It is proposed that the Screening Committee of a Crowdfunding Platform may have a strength of a minimum of 10 persons, which may have follow the following composition:at least 40% of the committee should be composed of professional with expertise in mentoring of startups and early stage ventures,at least 30% of the committee should be composed of professionals with experience in banking or capital markets,Page 50 of 66not more than 30% of the committee should be composed of persons of high caliber and qualifications which are nominated by the owner of the crowdfunding portal, but not on its payrolls.Question 14: Are the measures mentioned in paragraph 9.4.6 enough to ensure a seamless operation of the Crowdfunding Platform and avoidance of any conflict of interest? Suggest changes, if any, along with the rationale.Question 15: Any suggestions on the role and responsibility of the screening committee and its composition etc.?9.4.7 Along with the companies raising fund by crowdfunding platform, the investors also need to be subjected to a moderate level of due diligence. This is to make sure that investors, particularly ERIs, are accredited and that they invest in accordance to the net worth conditions specified by SEBI. The task of due diligence of investors in crowdfunding could be given to the platform or some third parties which can be SEBI registered intermediaries like brokers, depository participants (DP), Investment Advisers, Portfolio Managers etc. ERIs and HNIs may be required to submit, among other things, a net worth certificate from a Chartered Accountant to Stock Broker /Investment Adviser/Portfolio Manager and also make a declaration or sign a 'Risk Acknowledgement' regarding the understanding of risks in their investments.9.4.8 Crowdfunding Platforms may charge a nominal fee from the company seeking funds through the platform and the accredited investors looking for a good investment opportunity in the companies which shall be displayed on the website only after a comprehensive due diligence and screening.Question 16: Given that only Accredited Investors may be allowed to invest through Crowdfunding Platforms, it is important that their due diligence is conducted properly to confirm their eligibility. Are the entities mentioned in paragraph 9.4.4 capable in doing the same? Any suggestions in this regard?Page 51 of 66Question 17: Making the platform's revenue directly dependent on the fee from the issuers may lead to a conflict of interest. What could be the possible alternative revenue mechanisms for the platforms which may eliminate or reduce such conflicts?Question 18: Should there be any restriction on the fee charged by a crowdfunding platform to an issuer for getting access to the platform or an accredited investor for registration or should this be left as a commercial decision by the platform based on market forces?9.5 Equity based Crowdfunding (EbC)9.5.1 This route, as the name suggests, enables the issuers to raise upto Rs. 10 Crores online by issuing equity shares through a recognized crowdfunding platform and offering equity stake in their business to the accredited investors who are registered with the platform.9.5.2 A company desirous of raising funds by EbC route through a crowdfunding platform may do so after it duly satisfies the due diligence and screening criteria set by the platform.9.5.3 These issues shall be further subject to the following conditions:No single investor shall hold more than 25% stake in a company.The promoter(s) shall be required to maintain a minimum of 5% equity stake in the company for at least 3 years.9.5.4 The issuers shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraph 9.2 and follow the procedure as specified in paragraph 9.8. The Private Placement Offer Letter will contain, inter alia, the disclosures as mentioned in paragraph 9.3.9.5.5 The investors who invest in equity issues through EbC shall have rights of a equity shareholder as given in the Companies Act.Page 52 of 66Question 19: Any suggestions on the requirements in EbC to make it more transparent and investor friendly?9.6 Debt based Crowdfunding (DbC)9.6.1 This route, as the name suggests, enables the issuers to raise upto Rs. 10 Crores online by issuing debentures or debt securities through a recognized crowdfunding platform to the accredited investors who are registered with the platform.9.6.2 A company desirous of issuing debt securities by DbC route through a crowdfunding platform may do so after it duly satisfies the due diligence and screening criteria set by the platform and fulfills requirements as specified in paragraph 9.2.9.6.3 These issues shall be further subject to the following conditions:The debt securities issued should comply with requirements specified under Companies Act or rules made thereunder applicable to debentures or bonds.The issuer shall appoint a debenture trustee to hold the assets on behalf of the investors.The issuer shall need to create a Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR) of 25% of the value of the debentures.9.6.4 The issuers shall follow the procedure as specified in paragraph 9.8. The Private Placement Offer Letter in DbC shall contain, inter alia, the disclosures as mentioned in paragraph 9.3 and a summarized term sheet as specified in the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008.9.6.5 The debentures holders shall have rights as given under the Companies Act.Question 20: Any suggestions on the requirements in DbC to make it more transparent and investor friendly?Page 53 of 66Question 21: Is there any need to prescribe the limit on the leverage a company can take through DbC?Question 22: Is there a need to change the rules regarding appointment of Trustee and creation of Debenture Redemption Reserve in case of private placement of debt with no intention of listing which seeks to issue debentures through recognized crowdfunding platform?9.7 Fund based Crowdfunding (FbC)9.7.1 Under this route, the funds of the accredited investors registered with a recognized platform will be collected online through the platform and pooled under the AIF to invest in shares or debt securities in crowdfunded ventures which are displayed on a recognized crowdfunding platform.9.7.2 For this purpose, it is proposed to provide a separate class of funds under Category I AIFs to offer Fund based Crowdfunding as Category I AIF- Crowd Funds. The minimum and maximum corpus of such funds would be Rs. 10 Crores and Rs. 25 Crores respectively.9.7.3 As per the SEBI (AIF) Regulations, 2012, such funds will be able to solicit funds online from a maximum of 1,000 accredited investors. The requirement of the minimum investment of Rs. 1 Crore by every investor for an AIF is also proposed to be relaxed for this new class and brought to Rs. 25 Lacs. Under the proposal, funds can be solicited online from upto 1,000 accredited investors registered with a platform by displaying Crowd Funds on the crowdfunding platforms set up by class I or III entities as specified in paragraph 9.4.4.9.7.4 All the accredited investors viz. QIBs, Companies, HNIs and ERIs will be able to invest in these funds. These pooled monies will be then invested by Crowd Fund AIFs into start ups and SMEs displayed on a recognized crowdfunding platform under the terms or objectives of the scheme. The sponsor or manager need to maintain aPage 54 of 66continuing interest of at least 2.5% of the corpus in the form of investment in the fund and such interest shall not be through the waiver of management fees.9.7.5 This new class of Category I AIF-Crowd Funds, can also solicit funds online through crowdfunding platforms from the registered accredited investors, for deploying them further into donation based crowdfunding. Thus Crowd Funds may also invest in those companies displayed on the crowdfunding platforms which are incorporated as not-for-profit entities or social enterprises set up as Section 8 companies under Companies Act 2013, for charitable or community benefit or other public interest projects, with investors focusing more on altruistic reasons or general benefits, rather than any expectation of financial return to them.9.7.6 Further for accepting donation from the registered accredited investors, the minimum per capita investment can be set at Rs. 50,000. The grantor of donation shall not be entitled to any dividend or profit or gain.9.7.7 These Category I AIF Crowd Funds shall register with SEBI under the SEBI (AIF) Regulations and the application shall be made in the format as specified in the First Schedule to the said regulation under Form A. The disclosures in the Placement Memorandum of the Crowd Funds shall be similar to Category I AIF- VCFs. The ongoing disclosures and valuation requirements shall also be similar to the VCFs. The disclosures are mainly related to disclosures on fees and charges, management of conflicts of interest, investments and leverage, a prudent spread of risk and other safeguards.9.7.8 The Crowd Funds can, post registration with SEBI, get displayed on any Crowdfunding Platform set up by either Class I or Class III entities, to raise funds from a maximum of 1000 accredited investors (including QIBs, Companies, HNIs and ERIs) registered with the platform through issue of placement memorandum. The Crowd Funds may not be required to be subjected to the scrutiny of the Screening Committee of the platform. The Crowd Funds can channel the funds raised from its investorsPage 55 of 66through the platform into various companies which are displayed on the crowdfunding platform. Units of such funds may be issued only in dematerialized form.9.7.9 In contrast to EbC where the accredited investors directly hold equity of issues and are shareholders of the company and therefore have legal ownership, in FbC the investments of registered accredited investors are pooled and routed online through a Crowd Fund. The fund holds the equity in its name on behalf of the investors who are issued units of the fund rather than equity of the issuer, and thus have only beneficial ownership in the equity of the company.9.7.10 FbC addresses several regulatory issues like the restriction on the number of offers made in private placement, minimum investment of Rs. 20,000 worth of face value of securities by every investor etc. It also transfers the duty of investment decision making from ERIs and HNIs, who are not well versed with different investment strategies, to the fund managers, who are experts in this type of investment analysis.9.7.11 The requirement on ERIs to be consulted by a SEBI registered Investment Adviser or Portfolio Manager may not be applicable for investment through FbC.Question 23: Any suggestions on the requirements in FbC to make it more transparent and investor friendly?9.8 Procedure for offering through a Crowdfunding Platform9.8.1 There is restriction on public offering other than a prospectus based offer and mandatory listing except for private placement of securities. Therefore it has been proposed that the offer can be made through a web based recognized crowdfunding platform only to accredited investors who have been given access to the platform.9.8.2 A step-wise illustrative procedure is given as under:Page 56 of 66An issuer, satisfying the requirements as specified in paragraph 9.2 and interested in raising funds, gets displayed on a recognized crowdfunding platform by submitting requisite documents and undergoing due diligence and screening by the platform.The crowdfunding platform also maintains a list of accredited investors who have been given access to the platform to invest in the companies displayed on it. The accredited investors are allowed to register only after examination of KYC compliances and fulfillment of other requirements like net worth, appropriateness test, signing of Risk Acknowledgement etc. as mentioned in paragraph 9.1. Post registration, these accredited investors are given a Login ID and password to access the platform.Post screening by the Screening Committee of the crowdfunding platform, the companies interested in raising funds through the platform can put up a notice containing the brief of their business plan on the platform along with the funds required.This notice will be subjected to an open discussion on a forum or public board, like a chat room or chat board, provided by the platform, amongst the interested accredited investors and the issuer in which the proposed business plan will be analyzed and critiqued from different perspectives. This feature is provided to gauge the interest of the accredited investors and support an informed decision making by the prospective investors.The notice is intended to draw the attention of accredited investors registered with the platform and not an invitation to subscription. After perusing the plan and discussing it, the interested accredited investors can make a commitment or pledge to the company about the funds they intend to invest.Once adequate demand is gauged, the issuer may make the formal offer for subscription to those who have made commitment, not numbering more than 200 HNIs, ERIs and Companies collectively, and any number of QIBs, with the detailed online Private Placement Offer Letter, which inter alia may contain the disclosures mentioned in paragraph 9.7. This shall amount to an invitation or offer for subscription and shall be in compliance with the Section 42 of thePage 57 of 66Companies Act, 2013 and other rules and regulations pertaining to private placement of securities.Pursuant to perusing the Private Placement Offer Letter, the accredited investors may choose to invest in the company or may decide to withdraw their commitment.The subscription amount shall be collected from the accredited investors who choose to invest pursuant to perusal of Private Placement Offer Letter of the issuer and kept in a separate bank account. The crowdfund platform owner or a reputed designated third party shall open an escrow account with a Scheduled Commercial Bank to hold the subscription funds of the investors.The issue shall remain open for a maximum period of 15 days.The crowdfunding issue will be considered successful only if it is able to achieve a minimum pre-specified threshold, expressed in terms of percentage of original issue size as mentioned in the Private Placement Offer Letter. This threshold shall never fall below 50%. The subscription amount shall be transferred to the issuer by the platform owner or the designated third party, only if the threshold is achieved.The issuer shall allot the securities to the accredited investors who have subscribed to the issue within 15 days from the date of receipt of the subscription money. In case it fails to do so, it shall refund the entire sum to the subscribers within 15 days from the date of completion of 15 days. In case the issuer fails to refund the money within the aforesaid period, it shall be liable to refund that money with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the expiry of fifteenth day of securities allotment.The issuer shall file a return with RoC as required under Companies Act 2013.In case of FbC, the procedure as mentioned in paragraph 9.7 and particularly in 9.7.8, shall be applicable.Question 24: Any suggestion to simplify the procedure as specified in paragraph 9.8 within the existing legal framework?Page 58 of 669.9 Secondary Market9.9.1 Crowdfunding is intended to facilitate capital raising through online medium bystartups and SMEs and not for the resale of securities. There is no requirement of listing for trading and no listing obligation on the issuer. Crowdfunding platforms only allow an issuer to sell its own securities to raise capital and seldom provide a secondary market for such securities. Therefore many jurisdictions have imposed restriction on a secondary market of securities issued through crowdfunding.9.9.2 However different jurisdictions have prescribed provisions for providing some exit to the securities holders of crowdfunded ventures as given under:Jurisdiction Provisions for Secondary MarketUSA\tSecurities issued\tin crowdfunding may not be transferred by thepurchaser for one year after the date of purchase, except when transferred: (1) To the issuer of the securities; (2) to an accredited investor; (3) as part of an offering registered with the Commission; or (4) to a family member of the purchaser or the equivalent, or in connection with certain events, including death or divorce of the purchaser, or other similar circumstances, in the discretion of the Commission.UK\tAfter purchasing unlisted equity in a company, even if it remains a going-concern, investors will usually find there is no, or only a limited, secondary market for their investments. Consumers investing in such equity need to understand that they will probably have to wait until an event occurs, such as the sale of the company, a management buy-out or a flotation, before getting a return. Consumers should realize that, in the event of their death, ownership of these investments will probably need to be transferred to their beneficiaries.New\tThis matter has not yet been clarified. Requested for public comments.ZealandAustralia\tThis matter has not yet been clarified. Requested for public comments.Canada\t\tSecurities of a reporting issuer are subject to a four-month hold period (subject to certain other conditions being met).Securities of a non-reporting issuer are subject to an indefinite holdPage 59 of 66period and can only be resold under a prospectus exemption or under a prospectus.9.9.3 In the Indian scenario also, it is difficult to provide a secondary market trading framework for the companies displayed on a crowdfunding platform, as then it would be treated as a Stock Exchange. Hence, companies displayed on Crowdfunding Platforms will not be treated as Listed Companies and there will be no secondary market liquidity in such scrips and investors should be made aware about such risks before investing in such companies.9.9.4 The securities issued in crowdfunding by the issuer can be transferred by the investors as under:to the issuer of the security in accordance with the provisions of Companies Act 2013 and the rules made thereunder, pertaining to the buyback of securities by unlisted public limited companies,to another accredited investor registered with the platform,to a family member or relative or friend of the accredited investor or the equivalent.9.9.5 The promoter(s), however, shall be required to maintain a minimum of 5% equity stake in the company for at least three years from the date of the issue.9.9.6 The investor may get exit only when there is sale of the company, a management buyout or a floatation of IPO or listing of company on a recognized stock exchange in SME segment or main board.9.9.7 If there is any shareholder agreement between promoters of the issuing company and any AIF giving rights to such shareholders to sell their shares to the promoters etc., same shall be disclosed to all the accredited investors.Page 60 of 66Question 25: Any suggestion on additional avenues of exit or liquidity of securities in crowdfunding?9.10 Protection from Cybercrimes9.10.1 Crowdfunding Platform/Website is the center point of interaction between thecompanies and the prospective investors. Moreover it will also function as the repository of all the information and disclosures provided by the companies periodically. It occupies a very crucial position in the entire infrastructure. Therefore it needs to be secure and safe from all types of cyber-attacks.9.10.2 To protect the Crowdfunding platform from hacking/identity theft, etc., the necessary steps need to be taken by the owners of the Crowdfunding Platform.9.10.3 To provide communication security over the Internet, the crowdfunding platforms should be layered over Transport Layer Security (TLS)/ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Platform owner should ensure safety, secrecy, integrity and retrievability of the data. The platform owner shall have a adequate back-up, and Disaster management and recovery and restoration plans.9.10.4 It is desirable that platform owners draft a security policy which shall, then, be put in public for comments and analysis. There shall be regular audits by reputed external auditors who is CISA (Certified Information Systems Auditor) or otherwise appropriately qualified that the security measures taken by the Platform Owners are adequate and meet the requirements and that risk management systems are in place to identify and mitigate the risks arising out of the regular operations.Question 26: What kind of security features and IT Policies should be put in place to make the crowdfunding platform safe and secure from all sorts of cyber crimes?Page 61 of 669.11 Tax TreatmentTaxation of funds raised through crowdfunding shall be in accordance with the currenttax provisions applicable to the unlisted companies raising funds through equity or debt or an AIF.Question 27: Crowdfunding is intended to perform the role of an alternate funding option for entrepreneurs and investment option for investors in unlisted companies or Crowd Funds. With this view, what kind of taxation treatment would be suitable for the different stakeholders involved?10.0 Role of SEBI10.1 SEBI has been established with a triple mandate of protecting the investors' interests along with developing and regulating the Indian securities market. These are the guiding principles behind our policies and regulations. Therefore, to enable the small issuers to raise funds and facilitate the investors in an informed decision making, appropriate safeguards and disclosures are proposed to be put in place.10.2 SEBI's role in crowdfunding, which is proposed to provide a cost effective and efficient method of fund raising, will mainly be limited to:recognition of the Crowdfunding Portalsoversight and regulation of the Crowdfunding market in Indiaplaying no role in vetting of the Private Placement Offer letter of the issuing companiesissuance of guidelines/circular regarding information required to be disclosed in Private Placement Offer Letter or on an ongoing basis or requirements of due diligence and screening or any other matterconduct of periodic inspections or audits of Crowdfunding Platforms and enforcement of Crowdfunding RegulationsPage 62 of 6611.0 Cost and Benefit Analysis of the Proposal11.1 The proposed structure for crowdfunding will provide an enabling framework. Crowdfunding may provide an alternative source of capital for entrepreneurs that either have limited access to capital or have exhausted other available sources of capital. This also saves the entrepreneur from a lot of effort required in obtaining capital and allows him/her to focus on the business.11.2 One of the objectives of the regulations is to reduce the costs involved in raising funds for entrepreneurs. Under the existing regulations, an issuer is required to pay underwriter fees, legal and accounting fees, registrar and transfer agent fees, merchant banker fees, marketing & advertising fees or distribution commissions and other fees some of which may not be applicable in crowdfunding.11.3 Crowdfunding facilitates such entrepreneurs in raising funds without incurring too much of the costs by doing away with the requirement of appointing a merchant banker, marketing & advertising expenses and book building etc. Further, there shall be no listing requirements and no prospectus needs be filed with SEBI. However, a company seeking display in recognized crowdfunding platform may be required to pay fees to such platform, which is expected to be substantially lower in comparison to the current issue expenditure. The fees to a platform may be dependent on various factors like number of platforms in the market, number of companies seeking display at such crowdfunding platforms etc.11.4 Crowdfunding not only helps the issuers to raise money but also serves as a way of advertising for these companies. It helps in increasing their visibility which can directly or indirectly lead to the growth in their businesses. Crowdfunding is expected to spur entrepreneurship and benefit the entire economy.11.5 Crowdfunding also enables investors to make relatively modest investments across a range of opportunities with relatively low transaction costs and obtain equity positions in companies that may eventually prove to be successful and profitable, which they are not able to do under the current regulations. Platforms may also charge a nominal fee to its registered accredited investors for carrying out their due diligence.Page 63 of 66Platforms may also be required to pay some fee for recognition. Consultation process may assist in crystallizing such charges for the new framework.12.0 Public comments:12.1. Public comments and suggestions are solicited on the consultation paper. It does not necessarily imply that all or any of the comments will be invariably accepted for formulation of regulation. Interested persons may send their comments by e-mail to Mr. Aditya Sarda (adityas@sebi.gov.in) or Mr. Ankit Goel (ankitg@sebi.gov.in) on or before July 16, 2014.12.2 Comments and suggestions should be given in the following format:Name of Entity / Person / IntermediaryQuestion\tNo./ Suggestion\tProposal\t/\tSuggested\tRationaleon Paragraph No.\tChangesIssued on: June 17, 2014 .***********Disclaimer: References to various jurisdictions in this document have been based on the regulations/guidelines/consultation papers, etc. of the respective country regulators and news articles/websites and other secondary sources.

In transmission case, where title to shares are passed b y operation of law, the beneficiary need not carry out further formalities such a s duly executed stamped instrument of transfer a s stipulated in Section 108 of the Companies Act, 1956. The Company concerned also can not insist on such formalities.2. Inspite of the legislative intent to simplify the procedure of Transmission of Shares, companies have over a period of time evolved varying and diverse documentary compliances on the part of the legal representative of the deceased security holder.3. To address this issue and to evolve a uniform procedure and to alleviate and redress complaints received b y SEBI in relation to Transmission of Shares, Chairman, SEBI constituted a Group headed b y Shri R K Nair, ED, SEBI, with three objectives:(a ) Examining the procedures followed b y companies in relation to Transmission,(b ) Exploring the implementation of the concept of Either or Survivor in case of shares held in dematerialized mode and(c) Suggesting uniform norms and procedures to alleviate the sufferings of investors.4. To get a balanced and complete picture of the nuances and intricacies of the existing procedure and to recommend ways to simplify the same, the Group invited representatives from the following organizations : (a ) Registrars Association of India (RAIN), (b ) Registrar & Share Transfer Agents (R & STAs), (c) Public Sector and Private Sector Bank, (d ) N SDL, (e) CDSL, (f) Investors Association (IA) recognized b y SEBI and (g) ICSI member of Technical Committee on Transmission (SS-6)5. On analysis of the information available in terms of the present procedure, it wasobserved that hardships of legal representatives of deceased are mainly:? Ambiguity about procedures,* Shares shall have the same meaning as per the definition of Securities under section 2 (h) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956.Page 5 of 25? Cumbersome documentation and?\tLack of uniformity in the procedures.6. The Group discussed and deliberated on the issues and after 5 meetings narrowed down on the core procedural impediments that contribute to delay in the process of Transmission of Shares. The following core issues emerged:a )\tConservative approach adopted b y the Companies / Directors in exercising the discretion vested b y the Articles of Association (AOA),b ) Insistence b y companies to obtain probate of will b y beneficiary and lack of clear understanding of the legal provisions relating to Transmission of shares with respect to laws governing the will,c) Lack of awareness of nomination facility and the need to popularize nomination facility through proper investors education, andd ) The need to involve R & STAs, Depositories, DPs and Companies in creating awareness about nomination facility b y launching a special drive.Page 6 of 25BACKGROUNDSection 11 (1) of SEBI Act, 1992 states, Subject to the provisions of this Act, it shall be the duty of the Board to protect the interest of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market, b y such measures a sit thinks fit.To meet the objectives of Investor Protection and Market Development a s enshrined in the preamble of SEBI Act, 1992, SEBI and recognized IAs have been working together. Office of Investor Assistance and Education (OIAE) is a single point interface to redress investor grievances.Quarterly meeting of recognized IAs are organized to deliberate on problems faced b y investors, particularly retail and small. Investors Associations are encouraged to ventilate Investors issues to alleviate the problems / hardships.In the meeting of IAs held on 11.06.2007 instances of hardships faced b y investors in relation to Transmission of Shares were discussed. Three key issues emerged:? Ambiguity about procedures? Cumbersome documentation?\tLack of uniformity in the proceduresChairman, SEBI decided to constitute a Group to suggest suitable measures to address issues relating to difficulties faced b y the investors while dealing with Transmission of shares, both in physical and dematerialized mode. Shri R.K. Nair, Executive Director, SEBI was nominated Chairman of the Group and Shri A P Bakliwa l, President, Bombay Shareholders Association, Shri S.V.M .D. Rao, Chief General Manager, SEBI and Shri Ana nta Ba rua, Legal Adviser, SEBI a s other members with Shri Jeeva n Sonpa rote, Deputy General Manager, SEBI a s the Member Secretary.The terms of reference were:1.\tTo examine various procedures followed b y the companies and registrar and share transfer agents for transmission of physical shares2. To explore the implementation of the concept of Either or Survivor in depository system.Page 7 of 253. To suggest uniform norms and procedures relating to the transmission of physical shares, specifically with reference to documentation required for transmission.The Group, for the above purpose, was empowered to call information from the issuer companies and R & STAs and submit its report within a period of two months.MEETINGS AND DELIBERATIONS O F THE GROUPIn the first meeting of the Group, a discussion paper was deliberated upon and inter alia specific issues were discussed about the problems faced b y investors, legal provisions / issues involved and measures to simplify the procedure related to the Transmission of shares.In view of the nature of the issues involved, following persons were invited to thesubsequent rounds of the deliberations:-a) Representatives of RAINb ) Atleast two R & STAs, two companies, one public and one private sector bank.c) The Members of the ICSI Technical committee that codified the draft code fortransmission of shares,d ) Representatives of N SDL and CDSLe)\tOffice bearers of IAs recognized b y SEBITo understand the problems faced b y investors, at large, the Group also called information from a sample of 8 R & STA. R & STAs were asked to provide information in relation to 10 sample companies for which they act a s R & STA detailing the divergent practices followed b y the respective companies. The Group went through the various complaints received b y SEBI over the period. Information was sought from N SDL and CDSL in relation to the issues faced b y investors with respect to Transmission of shares held in dematerialized mode.Page 8 of 25INTRODUCTIONTo transmit is defined a s 1to cause to convey to another person or place. Also 2to pass on a right or obligation to heirs or descendants. and transmission is defined a s the 1action of transmitting or the fact of being transmitted: conveyance from one person to another.The word 'transmission' means devolution of title to shares otherwise than b y transfer, for example, devolution b y death, succession, inheritance, bankruptcy, marriage, etc. While transfer of shares is brought about b y delivery of a proper instrument of transfer (viz, transfer deed) duly stamped and executed, transmission of shares is done by forwarding the necessary documents (such a s a notarized copy of death certificate) to the company. On the death or lunacy of the original holder (single holder), his shares vest in his legal representative. On registration of transmission of shares, the person whose name is entered in the register of shareholders becomes the shareholder of the company and is entitled to all the rights and is subject to all the liabilities a s were of the original shareholder.Legal provisions related to Transfer b y legal representative is contained in section 109 of the Companies Act 1956, Section 109 reads a s,A transfer of the share or other interest in a company of a deceased member thereof made by his legal representative shall, although the legal representative is not himself a member, be as valid as if he had been a member at the time of the execution of the instrument of transfer.Section 109A deals with Nomination of shares which provides for nomination b y holder (s) of shares in respect of shares held b y them. Cases wherein a nominee has been appointed, the shares should vest in the nominee on the death of the member (s).Section 109B deals specifically with transmission of shares. As per section 109B, on the death of the shareholder, the nominee has the option either to register himself a s the holder of the shares of the deceased or to transfer the shares to any other person. The transferee (s) may not necessarily be the legal heirs of the deceased shareholder (s). Section 109B (1) states, Any person who becomes a nominee by virtue of the provisions of section 109A, upon the production of such evidence a s may b e required b y the Board andsubject as hereinafter provided, elect, either-\t.1 The Law Lexicon2 www.dictionary.comPage 9 of 25From the above, it becomes evident that the provisions of the Companies Act d o not specify the procedure to b e followed b y the companies for transmission and that the companies have the discretion to decide on the procedure as per their AOA and other relevant laws. The companies generally follow procedures a s laid down in their AOA and such other requirements that safeguard the companies from the consequences of future litigation and these procedures differ from company to company.Page 10 of 25EXISTING PRACTICE AND THE HARDSHIPS FACED BYINVESTORSDue to the fact that the Companies Act has not specifically mandated any set of documents which must be provided in relation to transmission, a n attempt has been made to summarize the problems / difficulties faced b y investors.Problems faced b y investors:1. Small investors who have made will are not able to produce the probate of the will. Obtaining a probate requires the investor to approach a court and it also involves payment of fees / stamp duty.2.\tWhile documents such a s indemnity and affidavit can be produced without much difficulty, procuring other documents such a s surety/ bank guarantee, no-objection certificate (NO C) from all legal heirs (particularly when a registered will is available), and issuance of press advertisement may cause inconvenience to investors.3. In case a shareholder who dies intestate (without executing a will), the applicant has to follow the cumbersome process a s given below:a )\tThe Application for issuance of succession certificate is to b e made in the court, where the properties of the deceased are situated or where he / she normally resided, and depending on the value of the estate of the deceased, the matter goes to the competent court on the basis of pecuniary jurisdiction.b ) Application is to b e made to the court with the names of all other heirs of the late relative as the respondents in the matter. Normally a newspaper notice is also issued apart from mandatory notice to the respondents.c) Upon the expiry of the time period (normally 1 and a half months) from the date of publication of the notice after the respondents have given their no objection, the court passes the orders for issuance of the Succession Certificate, for which the applicant has to submit Judicial Stamp papers of sufficient amount (a s per the prescribed court fees structure) in the court.d ) It roughly takes about 3-6 months from date of filing to receive the certificate.Page 11 of 254. The procedures brought out above, come at a cost to the investor. In some cases the cost of legal requirements and newspaper advertisement could exceed the value of the shares to be transmitted.5.\tVariation is also observed in the procedure followed b y different companies, particularly related to obtaining N O C from legal heirs, Surety/ Bank Guarantee and issue of press / newspaper advertisement.6. The protracted procedures also cause opportunity loss to the investors.7.\tSome of the procedures though not mandated b y law are in place basically a s safeguard to the companies so that they d o not face any claims / counter claims a t a later stage. Further, in respect of procedures adopted b y some of the sample companies, it has been observed that some have prescribed, the Company at itsdiscretion / under special circumstances waive requirements\t without specifyinga s to what are those special cases / circumstances?PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN PHYSICAL SHARESVarious companies listed with the Stock Exchanges have been following divergent practices in relation to the transmission of shares to the legal heir / nominee of the shareholder in case of the death of the original shareholder.Practices followed b y a sample of companies for the Transmission of Shares were obtained from web sites of companies. The following companies were part of the sample  HLL, RIL, REL, Jet Airways, SBI, ITC, Tata companies, HDFC, ICI Ltd.General observationsIt was observed that there is no problem in case the heirs of the deceased present a probate of a will. The problem lies in the divergent practices followed b y companies in cases where there is no will left b y the deceased or even if the will is there but there is no probate of the will. It is observed from the sample study that two different approaches are in use among the companies / R &SATs, which are a s follows:1. In the absence of a probate of will, some companies ask for a succession certificate or a letter of administration along with a request letter and transmission form to process the transmission. Some of the companies in thePage 12 of 25select sample d o not explain the procedure to be followed where there is a willwhich is not probated or where there is no will and no succession certificate.2.\tCertain other companies from the sample list have provided for a n alternateprocedure in case of absence of a probate of will / letter of administration / succession certificate. The alternate procedure is required even if there is a registered will.Some companies have evolved the alternate mechanism that apply only upto a threshold. In cases where the value / number of shares involved is lower than a certain threshold limit, companies seek alternate documents instead of insisting on probate of will / succession certificate which may be cumbersome and cost ineffective to obtain. As there is no standardization of the procedures, the documents sought differ from company to company. The documents sought b y the sample companies are listed below:-(a ) Request letter (all companies)(b ) Copy of death certificate (all companies)(c) Affidavit affirming the name of legal heirs / Affidavit sworn in b y theclaimants (all companies)(d ) Indemnity agreeing to indemnify the company against future claims that mayb e made on the company (all companies)(e) NO C from other heirs in favour of person claiming the title to shares (most companies  whereas one company in the sample study does not ask for this).(f) Bank Guarantee in favour of the Company for the market value of the Shares for specified period. (only one company in the sample has this requirement)(g) Surety Form seeking surety from one or two persons covering the value of shares involved. The surety form often requires financial details to be filled in b y the surety (only two group companies from the sample study have this requirement whereas others d o not require surety). The surety form mostly requires financial details to be provided such a s movable / immovable property and PAN no. etc.(h) Press Advertisement informing the public about the transmission request made to the Company (This requirement is there only for one company).Page 13 of 25PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN DEPOSITORY/ DEM AT SYSTEMThe procedures followed for transmission of shares in the depository systems is also cumbersome and is amplified in the case of joint holding. The procedures involved are outlined below:-Single HolderA. N SDL:N SDL requires that the legal heir(s) or the legal representative(s) of the deceased person submit an instruction called the Transmission Request Form (TRF) to the Depository Participant (DP) along with the following documents:a .\tA copy of the death certificate duly notarizedb .\tA copy of the Succession certificate duly notarized or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction where the deceased has not left a will; orc.\tA copy of the probate or Letter of Administration duly notarized.If the legal heir(s) or the legal representative(s) express inability to produce either of the documents mentioned under (b ) and (c) above, and the market value of the shares held in each account of the deceased a s on the date of application for transmission does not exceed Rs. 1 la kh, then the DP will process the transmission request on the basis of the following documents:a .\tTransmission form;b .\tCopy of the death certificate duly notarized;c.\tLetter of Indemnity duly supported b y a guarantee of an independent Surety acceptable to the Depositories, made on appropriate non judicial stamp paper;d .\tAn Affidavit made on appropriate non judicial stamp paper; ande.\tN O C(s) from all the legal heir(s) who d o not object to such transmission.The procedure followed b y N SDL is similar to that followed b y companies for physical shares, and the alternate procedure is made available for shares of value less than Rs.1Page 14 of 25lakh. The surety form sought b y N SDL also seeks financial details of movable / immovable property held b y the surety, a s well a s details such a s PAN no. etc.B. CDSL:CDSL requires that the claimant should submit TRF along with the following documents to the concerned DP:1. In case of the death of the sole holder wherein the holder has appointed a nomineea .\tNotarized copy of the death certificate;2. In case of the death of the sole holder wherein the holder has not appointed a nomineea .\tNotarized copy of the death certificate;b . Any of the below mentioned documents:i.\tSuccession certificateii.\tCopy of will and probateiii.\tLetter of administrationThe DP after ensuring that the application is genuine will transfer the shares to the account of the claimant. In case the market value of the shares d o not exceed Rs. 1 la kh, the Board of Directors of CDSL, even in the absence of the documents specified a t (b ) above, has the discretion to transmit the shares to the heir / legal representative on such terms and conditions a sit may specify.Joint HolderThe procedure of transmission in case of d e ma t account operated in joint names is similar to that followed in case of transmission of shares in physical form. In case the deceased was one of the joint holders, then the surviving holders have to request the DP vide a form called TRF along with a copy of notarized death certificate to transmit the shares lying in the account of the deceased to the account of the surviving holders. For this purpose, the surviving joint holder(s) necessarily have to open a new Beneficial Owner (BO) account with their name in the same sequence in which the names appear in the joint account to b e closed.There have been suggestions from various quarters of investors that d e ma t account should be treated like a bank account and the procedure followed b y banks for such accounts should b e replicated in the depository accounts. Some of the suggestions werePage 15 of 25a .\tOperation of BO Account on Either or Survivor basis on the similar lines a s isdone in case of Bank Accounts; andb . Continuation with the same account instead of closure of the account in case one of the account holders dies.As per article 25(1) of Schedule Ito the Companies Act, 1956, the surviving joint holder is entitled to the shares in case of death of a joint shareholder. The surviving joint holder(s) has a choice to get himself / themselves registered a s the shareholder(s) or to transfer the shares a s per Article 26. Where he / they elect to retain the shares, he / they are required to be registered a s the sole shareholder / remaining joint holders. In such a case, the new holder is allotted a new folio number, i.e. it is treated a s a different folio from that of the original joint holder.The practice a s prevalent in case of physical shares has been replicated in the dematerialized environment. At present, if one of the joint holders dies, the surviving joint holder necessarily has to open one more BO account and has to transfer the shares from the existing account.Page 16 of 25ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONThe Group deliberated on the aforesaid issues and felt that the existing rigorous procedures of companies and R & STAs are depriving the investors the fruits of their investment decision. The group felt that there is a n imperative need to simplify the procedure involved in relation to the Transmission of shares, particularly in view of the fact that investments in shares are made to provide financial assistance in times of need.Threshold and standardisation of documentsPhysical environment:Transmission of shares held in physical form can be categories into two broad sub categories.CASE A: Cases wherein the shares are held in single name in varied companies and the Estate of the deceased is quite large.In such cases, the heirs of the deceased obtain succession certificate, probate of the will or letter of administration a s the case may b e . As the succession certificate / probate of will / letter of administration is already there in respect of the property (including the shares) bequeathed, cases falling under these categories pose no major problem and the turn around time starting with lodgement of claim form till the dispatch of certificates after effecting transmission ranges from 3 to 4 weeks.CASE B:  Cases wherein value of the holdings of the deceased shareholder is quite small compared to the cost of the legal representation in obtaining succession certificate, probate of the will or letter of administration a s the case may be . It has been observed that the majority of the cases fall under this category and should b e the focus area for significant improvement / simplification of the procedure. This would reduce the hardships faced b y investors.The Board of Directors of the respective companies are normally vested with significant powers and discretion b y the AOA in relation to the transmission without production of legal documents. Further, some companies have prescribed threshold limits in terms of value of the shares exceeding which the company requires more stringent procedure in relation to transmission a s a n investors friendly measure. This alleviates the undue hardships caused to the investors.Page 17 of 25Divergent views prevail with regard to probate of will. Under Section 57 and Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act 1925, requirement of probate arises only where the properties are situated a t Mumb a i, Che nna i and West Bengal. Thus it would follow that requiring the heirs to obtain a probate at places other than Mumb a i, Che nna i and West Bengal is unjustified. This needs to be taken into account b y the companies. Again the provisions of the Indian Succession Act d o not apply to Mohammedans and Christians (i.e. Communities other than Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Ja ins). Therefore, companies can adopt a pro-active policy while dealing with these two communities.Despite the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, most companies are insisting on the probate of the will b y citing the requirement under the AOA of the respective companies, which requires that such probate should b e obtained.The Group felt that a threshold limit both in term of number of shares and in terms of the market value of the shares, should b e fixed and upto the threshold limit, the company should not seek legal documents in the form of succession certificate / probate of will/letter of administration.The group felt that the threshold limit of a holding of 200 shares or a value of Rs 1 lakh, which ever is higher shall be appropriate. U pto this threshold the companies shall transmit the title to the shares only with the following documents:-i. Affidavit  to the effect of the claim of legal ownership to the shares,ii. Deed of Indemnity  indemnifying the company along with Surety andiii. NO C from other legal heir(s), wherever applicable, along with Claim Form / TRF,As there is no prescribed format in relation to the documents to be furnished along with TRF, there is a need to formalize the documents and their formats.The Group observed that some of the companies had more liberal thresholds. The intent of the Group is not to interfere with such thresholds which are more than the one stated above. The Group thus recommends that if any of the companies are having a more liberal threshold they shall continue to d o so, and companies desiring to set liberal threshold should be able to d o so. The threshold specified herein be the basic minimum that a company shall adhere to.Page 18 of 25Dematerialised environmentWhile the above threshold would apply to the holding in physical, there cannot be a mirror application of this concept in the depository environment for all holding in the various companies. Threshold limit in case of shares held in physical mode is applicable company-wise and only if the values of the shares in respective companies exceed the threshold limit, the claimant / heir may be required to submit succession certificate / probate of will/letter of administration.However, in case of shares held in dematerialized mode, in a single BO account, the account holder can hold shares of several companies and fixing a threshold limit company-wise would not be practically feasible a s the holder can hold the shares in a particular BO account which may run in crores. Further, in case of BO account, the documents which the claimant of the deceased needs to submit for transmission is account-wise and not company-wise and this saves the claimant from the undue hardship of approaching the respective companies whose shares are to be transmitted. Group felt that the threshold a s specified in shares held in physical mode shall not apply in case of shares held in dematerialized mode. However, the existing threshold of Rs. 1 la kh in value as provided in the b yelaws of the Depositories shall continue to apply.Joint holders in Dem at ModeIn relation to BO account held in joint names, a s per the existing practice, when a n accountholder dies, the surviving holders have to make an application to the DP, along with fresh set of documents (a s required in case of opening of a new account), to open a new account in the name of the surviving member(s), appearing in the same order, a s in case of original account. This is time consuming and tantamount to duplication of documents, which are already in possession of DP. Though, in relation to the automatic opening of a new BO account on the basis of the existing documents, Depositories expressed their concern in the form of possibility of change of name / address, change in residential status, updating of signature, changes in appearance due to age, medical disabilities etc. and the same may need to be incorporated in the records.The Group agreed that the concerns were genuine but felt that the opening of the new BO account can be on the basis of the existing documents already in the possession of DP(s), except in case of upd a tion of the documents a s per Know Your Client (KYC) norms, and any other additional documents for transmission. For this purpose Depositories shall make suitable changes in their bye-laws/ business rules/ operational instructions, etc.Page 19 of 25As regards the scenario for operation of the account on Either Basis, it was informed that in cases of accounts held in joint names, the holder(s) in anyway has the option of operation of the BO account on Either Basis on production of duly executed Power of Attorney (POA) executed in favour of other account holder(s). The present system is working smoothly without any hassle or complaint. In view of this the Group did not feel the need for any further change in the existing provisions.Nomination Facility:Nomination is defined a s an act of nominating a person to act on his behalf in his absence. In case of shares, any holder of the security a t any time can nominate a person to whom the nominators interest in those shares shall vest in the event of the death of the nominator. The nomination once made can be changed a s many times a s desired b y the nominator.Section 109A of the Companies Act talks about Nomination of Shares. Nomination is required to b e made in the prescribed manner, i.e., in Form 2B [prescribed under rule 4CCC/5D of the Companies (Central Governments) General Rules & Forms, 1956]. Non individuals including a society, trust, body corporate, partnership, ka rta of HUF and holder of POA cannot make a nomination.As per Section 109A (3) of the Companies Act, a nomination made as per the provisions of the Act overrides anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, including any law of succession or will or any other testamentary law, including anything contrary contained in the AOA of the company.The investor can easily save their legal heirs from the legal hassles and the rigours of transmission of shares b y appointing a nominee in the prescribed form.In the absence of nomination, the company needs to transmit the shares to the person(s) who a s per law has the legal right to the shares. This forces the companies to require adequate documentation from the legal heirs to prove their right to ownership of the shares. This is a piquant situation for the company. If the company does not d o its due diligence at this stage, the company may b e dragged into legal wrangle in case of counter disputes regarding the right to ownership. This casts the onerous responsibility on the company and the directors to ensure that all rights to ownership of shares are properly scrutinized so a s to avoid any future litigation on this count.Nomination is a very effective remedy to the situation. Once a shareholder appoints a nominee, then a s per the law, the companys liability towards the event stands discharged to the extent that it has transmitted the shares to the nominee appointed b yPage 20 of 25the shareholder. It is then the nominees responsibility to dispose of the shares or otherwise to the legal heirs.The intention of legislature in inserting specific provisions related to nomination facility in the Companies Act is to see that the company is discharged in relation to the impugned shares, in case the same is transmitted to the nominee and in case of dispute, the matter could b e settled inter se the nominee and the disputing legal heirs.Many investors are not aware of the nomination facility and its benefits; hence d o not avail of this facility. Thus the issue is more of creating / generating awareness amongst the investors about the benefits of the facility provided in law. In fact this fact was fairly acknowledged way back in 1999, which is evident in Press Release dated July 23, 1999 issued b y the Department of Company Affairs, the text of which is reproduced below:-Under the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1999, the shareholders have been allowed to nominate a person for their shares, debentures and deposits. The form in which the nomination has to be filed has been notified by the Department of company Affairs under the amended Companies Act. Earlier, holders of shares and debentures in a company did not enjoy the nomination facility for shares, debentures and deposits, which caused hardships to them. They were required to obtain a letter of succession from the competent authority. The facility of nomination is intended to make the company law in tune with the present day economic policies of liberalization and deregulation. This is also intended to promote investors confidence in capital market and to promote the climate for intercorporate investment in the country.If properly utilised b y the investors, this facility could prove to be a very useful remedy against all the problems faced b y the investors while grappling with the issue related to the transmission of shares.Group felt that efforts need to b e made to make filling up of the nomination form mandatory, in a phased manner. However, if a person subscribing for the shares does not wish to file his nomination, he shall necessarily have to give a declaration to the said effect.The Group felt that this facility of nomination should also be propagated and encouraged by the Depositories. With a view to encourage such a practice, the group recommends that the Depositories embark on a special drive to create awareness about the benefits of the nomination facility.A special drive should b e targeted at all its existing BOs who have not made nomination, b y way of a special letter / communiqu drawing the attention of the BOs to avail of the nomination facility or to take on record the declaration of the BO that hePage 21 of 25does not want to nominate any body. This shall be apart from the normal communication channels that the Depositories have with its BOs for such messages.As regards new accounts opened on or after October 01, 2007, it shall be provided for a t the account opening stage itself that the nomination is insisted upon. In case the person is not interested to nominate, then such a person would have to give a positive declaration to the effect that he does not want nomination for his account a s under: N o, I d o not want to nominate anyone on my behalf.As regards nomination, to place matters beyond doubt, it is recommended that provisions similar to sec 109A & 109B of the Companies Act 1956 should b e inserted in Depositories Act so that a single nomination can b e made for all shares held in the BO account.Attestation of documentsDuring the deliberations, representations were received highlighting the insistence on the notarised copy of the documents for the various processes involved in the shares transactions, including transmission.The Group felt that if the basic purpose of notarization is to authenticate the documents, even attestation of the documents, under seal, b y a ga zetted officer should suffice.Time FrameTo ensure that the transmission cases are dealt with in a time bound manner, a stipulation of time limit on similar lines a s has been stated in Clause 12A (3) in relation to Transfer b y way of insertion / amendment to the said Clause of the Listing Agreement should also b e made for transmission.Page 22 of 25RECOMMENDATIONSIn view of these discussions, the Group makes the following recommendations for simplifying the procedure in relation to Transmission of Shares in the physical and dematerialized environment:-Physical SharesStandard documentsA. Clause 7 of the Listing Agreement be amended to incorporate a clause specifying a threshold limit upto which the companies would insist on only the following documents in relation to transmission:-i. Affidavit  to the effect of the claim of legal ownership to the shares,ii. Deed of Indemnity  indemnifying the company along with Surety andiii. N O C from other legal heir(s), wherever applicable, along with Claim Form / TRF,B. The group recommends the standardization of these documents. These formats are enclosed a s anne xure to the report.ThresholdC. The Group recommends that this threshold b e fixed a t holding of 200 shares or Rs. 1 lakh in value, whichever is higher.i.\tThe prescribed threshold limit shall be the basic minimum limit to b eadhered to b y all the listed companies. The companies having higher threshold shall continue to d o so, and also can set liberal threshold.ii. Thus in effect this threshold shall apply to companies who have not yet fixed any such threshold, and also those companies whose threshold is less than that specified above.NominationD. To encourage nomination in physical shares, the Companies, IAs and SEBI shall embark on a special drive through the Investors Awareness Campaigns and the other education efforts to urge shareholders to utilize the nomination facility.Page 23 of 25Dematerialized sharesJoint holdersE. In relation to BO account held in joint names, DP(s) shall automatically open new account on an application b y the surviving member(s) based on existing documents, except in case of upd a tion of the documents required a s per the Know Your Client norms, and additional documents such a s notarized / attested copy of the death certificate of the deceased account holder(s), TRF, etc. The Depositories shall amend their b yelaws / business rules, operational instructions to give effect to this.NominationF. The nomination facility shall be encouraged b y the Depositories. Depositories shall launch a special drive with the help of DPs and take pro-active steps to ensure that all its existing BO accounts are updated with nomination. The DPs shall specifically target its BOs which have not opted for nomination b y way of special letter drawing the attention of the BOs to the benefits of nomination. This shall be apart from the normal communication channels that the Depositories / DPs have with its BOs for such messages.G. As regards new accounts opened on or after October 01, 2007, it shall be provided for a t the account opening stage itself that the nomination is insisted upon. In case the person is not interested to nominate, then such a person would have to give a positive declaration to the effect that he does not want nomination for his account a s under: N o, I do not want to nominate anyone on my behalf.H. As regards nomination, to place matters beyond doubt, it is recommended that provisions similar to sec 109A & 109B of the Companies Act 1956 should b e inserted in Depositories Act so that a single nomination can b e made for all shares held in the BO account.Time Fram eI. To ensure that the transmission cases are dealt with in a time bound manner, a stipulation of time limit on similar lines a s has been stated in Clause 12A (3) inPage 24 of 25relation to Transfer b y way of insertion / amendment to the said Clause of the Listing Agreement should also b e made for transmission.AttestationJ.\tFor the purposes of attestation of the documents required b y the companies andDepositories, the attestation of a Gazetted Officer, under its seal shall also suffice.Shri A.P.

The existence of an efficient and smooth-functioning market for takeovers plays an important role in the economic development of a country. It is a widely recognized fact that one of the key elements of a robust corporate governance regime in any country is the existence of an efficient and well-administered set of Takeover Regulations. Regulations on takeovers seek to ensure that the takeover markets operate in a fair, equitable and transparent manner.2. In keeping with the foregoing, India also has seen a steady evolution of a set of capital market regulations in respect of substantial acquisition of shares and takeovers. While the initial threads of regulation were incorporated in the late 1980s through Listing Agreement, provisions for a legal framework was provided in 1992 by a statute, viz. the SEBI Act, 1992. The SEBI Act, 1992 expressly mandated SEBI to regulate substantial acquisition of shares and takeovers by suitable measures. Accordingly, SEBI provided a legal framework by making the Takeover Regulations of 1994, which came into force on November 4, 1994.3. In November 1995, SEBI appointed a committee to review the Takeover Regulations of 1994 under the chairmanship of Justice P.N. Bhagwati (the Bhagwati Committee). The said committee submitted its report in January 1997. Taking into consideration its recommendations, the Takeover Regulations of 1997 were notified by SEBI on February 20, 1997, repealing the Takeover Regulations of 1994. These regulations were periodically amended in response to events and developments in the marketplace, regulatory and judicial rulings as well as evolving global practices as considered appropriate. In 2001, a review of the Takeover Regulations of 1997 was carried out by a reconstituted committee chaired by Justice P.N. Bhagwati. The reconstituted Bhagwati committee submitted its report in May 2002. Based on the same, further amendments were made to the Takeover Regulations of 1997. So far, the Takeover Regulations of 1997 have been amended 23 times.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 6 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India4. There has been a steady increase in corporate restructuring by Indian companies to adapt to the evolving competitive landscape. This can be seen from the number of takeovers of listed companies increasing from an average of 69 a year during the period between 1997 and 2005 to an average of 99 a year during the period between 2006 and 2010.5. Taking into consideration the growing level of M&A activity in India, the increasing sophistication of takeover market, the decade-long regulatory experience and various judicial pronouncements, it was felt necessary to review the Takeover Regulations of 1997.6. Accordingly, SEBI, vide its order dated September 4, 2009, constituted the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee with the mandate to examine and review the Takeover Regulations of 1997 and to suggest suitable amendments, as deemed fit.7.\tThe composition of the Committee is as under:(a)\tMr. C.

Substantial acquisition of shares in, or takeover of, a listed company impacts a host of stakeholders, such as, the acquirer, the target company, the management and the public shareholders. It is critical that the legal framework regulating such substantial acquisition of shares and takeovers is precise, unambiguous and predictable, and balances multiple, and at times, conflicting interests of such stakeholders. For instance, the public shareholder of the target company would be keen to get the highest possible price for his shares, while the acquirer would want to shoulder the least possible financial and regulatory burden. The target company may wish to support, oppose or remain neutral to, a transaction, often depending on who the acquirer is. It then falls upon the regulator to balance the interests of various stakeholders and to provide for a fair, equitable and transparent regime that addresses the concerns of all stakeholders.9. In drafting the Proposed Takeover Regulations, the Committee adopted an approach of balancing and calibrating such conflicting objectives. While the Committee believes that the Proposed Takeover Regulations, by and large, strike such a balance, the Regulations do recognize and accord primacy to the goal of protection of the interests of the public shareholders in takeover situations.10. The Committee also recognizes that no regulation would be able to provide for every situation that may arise in the domain of economic activity. However, if the regulatory intent, purpose and underlying philosophy are clearly understood and articulated, these can provide guidance even in ambiguous situations.11. The Committee believes that the stated objectives of the Takeover Regulations of 1997 continue to remain valid and relevant. As the Committee is recommending substantive changes to the Takeover Regulations of 1997, it decided to draft a new text of Takeover Regulations.12. It is important to restate the fundamental objectives of the Proposed Takeover Regulations. These are:-a.\tTo provide a transparent legal framework for facilitating takeover activities;Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 8 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiab.\tTo protect the interests of investors in securities and the securities market, taking into account that both the acquirer and the other shareholders or investors and need a fair, equitable and transparent framework to protect their interests;c. To balance the various, and at times, conflicting objectives and interests of various stakeholders in the context of substantial acquisition of shares in, and takeovers of, listed companies.d. To provide each shareholder an opportunity to exit his investment in the target company when a substantial acquisition of shares in, or takeover of a target company takes place, on terms that are not inferior to the terms on which substantial shareholders exit their investments;e. To provide acquirers with a transparent legal framework to acquire shares in or control of the target company and to make an open offer;f.\tTo ensure that the affairs of the target company are conducted in the ordinary course when a target company is subject matter of an open offer;g. To ensure that fair and accurate disclosure of all material information is made by persons responsible for making them to various stakeholders to enable them to take informed decisions;h. To regulate and provide for fair and effective competition among acquirers desirous of taking over the same target company; andi. To ensure that only those acquirers who are capable of actually fulfilling their obligations under the Takeover Regulations make open offers.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 9 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaMethodology:13. The Committee held its first meeting on September 17, 2009. The Committee felt that the views from the public on as many issues as possible should be considered while undertaking a comprehensive review of such an important area of corporate activity.14. For the purpose, a press release was issued on September 17, 2009 seeking suggestions and inputs in a structured manner from the public on any issue considered relevant. The public comments and suggestions received were thematically collated and classified for consideration by the Committee. The Committee held 21 meetings. In addition to this, the sub-committees constituted by the Committee to examine certain specific issues had also met several times.15. The Committee noted that over the years, SEBI had issued various interpretative letters and informal guidance letters. The Securities Appellate Tribunal and the Supreme Court have interpreted several provisions of the existing regulations. The Committee has considered these developments while formulating the text of the Proposed Takeover Regulations.16. The Committee has also taken into consideration the prevailing practices and key regulatory requirements relating to takeovers in several other jurisdictions such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, European Union, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, UK and USA. The Committee has benefited from such a comparative study in formulating its approach for the Proposed Takeover Regulations.Structure of the Report:17. This Report is in three parts:-a.\tPart I contains the salient features of the Proposed Takeover Regulations;b.\tPart II contains the Committee deliberations and key recommendations;c.\tPart III contains the draft text of the Proposed Takeover Regulations.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 10 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India18. Since the text of the draft regulations has been provided in Part III, Part II of the Report is focused on major policy framework and the process involved.19. The Committee has also taken note of the observation of the Supreme Court of India in a recent judgment where a statement of objects and reasons for provisions of subordinate legislation has been recommended. The Committee has provided an initial draft of explanatory notes on clauses and has suggested that SEBI finalize the same along with the text of the Proposed Takeover Regulations.20. The Committee wishes to thank the large number of individuals and institutions who readily responded to the Committees request for their views and comments on the existing Takeover Regulations, which facilitated the deliberations of the Committee. The Committee also wishes to place on record its profound appreciation for the committed and sincere efforts of Mr. Deep Mani Shah, Assistant General Manager, SEBI and Ms. Rashmi Menon, Manager, SEBI who assisted the Committee in researching and analyzing various facets and worked within tight timelines while drafting the report.21. Members of the sub-group of the Committee, comprising of Mr. Deep Mani Shah and Ms. Rashmi Menon from SEBI, and also Ms. Anna Abraham Mr. Vikas Verma, Mr. Shailesh Rathi and Mr. Rachit Sabharwal from Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Limited, and Mr. Sohit Kapoor, Mr. Devendra Dhanesha, Ms. Nivedita Joshi and Mr. Abhinandan Raghuthaman from DSP Merrill Lynch, under the overall guidance of Ms. Neelam Bhardwaj, deserve a special mention for their timely inputs and assistance in compilation and analysis of various market data.22. The Committee would also like to thank the SEBI team in the Division of Corporate Restructuring, including Mr Srikant Kumar Mishra, Mr V. Balakrishnan, Ms Suchismita Sahoo and Ms. Shameen Ahammed, for their efforts in the preparation, collation and analysis of diverse data and documents for the perusal and consideration of the Committee.23. The Committee is grateful to Mr. C. B. Bhave, Chairman, SEBI, for providing requisite support to the Committee to enable it to complete the assignment of reviewing the Takeover Regulations and making appropriate recommendations.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 11 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaPART I: SALIENT FEATURES OF THE PROPOSED TAKEOVER REGULATIONSOpen Offer ObligationInitial Trigger.^\tAcquisitions of an aggregate of 25 % or more voting rights in a target company would require the acquirer to make an open offer. [See Regulation 3(1)].Creeping Acquisition Trigger.^\tAn acquirer holding 25 % or more voting rights in a target company is allowed to acquire additional voting rights in the target company up to 5 % within a financial year, without making an open offer. [See Regulation 3(2)].Control Trigger.^\tRegardless of the level of shareholding and acquisition of shares, acquisition of control over a target company would require the acquirer to make an open offer. [See Regulation 4].Indirect Acquisitions.^\tAcquisition of shares or voting rights in, or control over any entity that would enable the acquirer to exercise or direct the exercise of such percentage voting rights in, or control over the target company, as would attract the obligation to make an open offer, would be regarded as an indirect acquisition, requiring the acquirer to make an open offer. [See Regulation 5(1)].^\tIf the indirectly acquired target company is a predominant part of the business or entity being acquired, the Proposed Takeover Regulations would treat such indirect acquisition as a direct acquisition for all purposes. [See Regulation 5(2)].Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 12 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaVoluntary Open Offer^\tShareholders holding shares entitling them to exercise 25 % or more of the voting rights in the target company may, without breaching minimum public shareholding requirements under the listing agreement, voluntarily make an open offer to consolidate their shareholding. [See Regulation 6].Offer SizeGeneral Rule.^\tAny open offer under the Proposed Takeover Regulations would be for 100 %, i.e., for all the shares held by all the other shareholders of the target company [See Regulation 7(1)].Exception for Voluntary Open Offer.^\tAs an exception to the 100 % offer rule, a voluntary open offer can be made for the acquisition of shares representing at least 10 % but shall not exceed such number of shares which will take the holding of the acquirer and persons acting in concert with him to beyond maximum non-public shareholding permitted under the listing agreement. [See Regulation 7(2)].^\tAn acquirer who has acquired shares in the preceding fifty two weeks would not be eligible to make such a voluntary open offer [See Proviso to Regulation 6(1)].^\tSuch an acquirer would also be barred from making any acquisition for six months after the open offer. [See Regulation 6(2)].^\tUpon a competing offer being made, such an acquirer would be permitted to increase his offer size to a normal full-sized open offer within fifteen business days. [See Proviso to Regulation 7(2)].Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 13 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaPublic Shareholding^\tAn acquirer, who is making a mandatory offer triggered by either substantial acquisition (viz. above 25 %) or acquisition of control, but not pursuant to creeping acquisition, would be permitted to state upfront while making the open offer that if his holding in the target company along with persons acting in concert crosses the delisting threshold pursuant to the open offer, the target company may be delisted. [See Regulation 7(4)].^\tIf such an intention to delist is not stated upfront, or the response to the open offer is such that the public shareholding could fall below the minimum level required under the listing agreement but remains above the delisting threshold, the acquirer would be required to either bring his holding down to ensure compliance by the target company with the listing agreement, or proportionately reduce both his acquisitions under the agreement that triggered the open offer and the acquisitions under the open offer. [See Regulation 7(5)].Exemption from open offer obligations^\tExemptions have been streamlined and classified on the basis of the specific charging provision from which exemptions would be available, with conditions for eligibility for such exemptions. Some of the areas where changes have been recommended include increase in voting rights due to buy-back of shares, schemes of arrangement that do not involve the target company, certain inter se transfers, corporate debt restructuring and rights issues. [See Regulation 10].^\tSEBI would continue to have the power to grant exemption from making an open offer. SEBI would also continue to have the discretion to give relaxation from strict compliance with procedural requirements and the same would be linked to specific conditions that would have to be met. However, the requirement of making a mandatory reference to a Panel by SEBI before granting an exemption has been done away with and such requirement has now been made discretionary. [See Regulation 11].Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 14 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaOffer Price^\tThe minimum price payable as the offer price continues to be regulated and shall be the highest of:o\tthe negotiated price under the agreement that attracted the open offer;o\tvolume-weighted average price paid by the acquirer and persons acting in concert in the preceding fifty-two weeks;o\thighest price paid by the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him during the preceding twenty-six weeks;o\tsixty trading day volume weighted average market price (for frequently traded shares).^\tTo compute the offer price for indirect acquisitions, in addition to the above parameters, any higher price paid during the period between contracting of the primary transaction and the public announcement has also to be considered.^\tIn case of indirect acquisitions of the target company, the offer price would stand increased at the rate of 10 % per annum calculated on a pro-rata basis for the period from the date of the primary transaction being announced in the public domain until the date of actual detailed public statement in respect of the target company. Such revised offer price shall be payable to all shareholders who tender their shares in the open offer.[See Regulation 8].Mode of payment^\tThe offer price may be paid in the form of cash or securities like shares, convertibles, secured debt instruments of the acquirer or of persons acting in concert with him or a combination of these modes. To ensure that the equity shares given in consideration for the open offer are liquid, eligibility conditions have been stipulated. However, if shares of the target company carrying more than 10 % voting rights have been acquired for cash in the preceding 52 weeks, shareholders to whom the open offer is made may opt to receive the offer price only in cash.

(See Para 10.6 in Part II of this Report)******Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 17 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaPART II: COMMITTEE DELIBERATIONS AND KEY RECOMMENDATIONS1.0\tOffer Size and Minimum Public Shareholding RequirementOffer SizeCurrent Provisions:1.1\tThe Regulations currently require that on acquisitions resulting in triggering regulations 10, 11 and 12, the acquirer is mandatorily required to make an open offer for a minimum of 20 % of the voting capital (reckoned as on the fifteenth day after closure of the offer).Committee Deliberations:1.2\tAlthough acquirers are currently allowed to make open offers for more than the minimum 20 %, such open offers have been rare. Data reveals that during the last four years, in less than 15 % of the open offers, the offer size has been higher than the mandatory minimum requirement of 20 %. (See Annexure 1)1.3\tThe Committee observed that such a framework gives rise to inequity  a substantial shareholder would get superior treatment by way of a complete exit as opposed to the public shareholder who would get to exit only partially if the response to the open offer is larger than the size of the open offer. For example, a shareholder holding 60 % would be able to sell his entire stake to the acquirer triggering an open offer. However, if the consequential open offer is made for only 20 % of the target company (the current minimum offer size), the remaining shareholders viz. the shareholders holding 40 % would not have an opportunity for a full exit, especially if all or most of them desire to do so. The shares tendered in response to the open offer would then have to be accepted on a proportionate basis in case of over-acceptance, and if all of them tender their acceptance, then each such public shareholder would be able to sell only half of their shareholding, with the balance being returned to them after the open offer is completed. One of the attendant consequences is that the public shareholder is currently unable to exit fully and realize the full premium, if any, on his entire share holding.1.4\tThe Committee observed that several international jurisdictions require that pursuant to a change in control, acquirers must make an offer for 100 % of the outstandingReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 18 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiavoting capital of a company. The Committee also observed that a majority of the suggestions received from the public in this regard sought increase in the offer size.1.5\tThe Committee observed that historically only a minority of open offers have been over-accepted (Only 42 cases out of total 392 open offers in the last 4 years were over-accepted). An analysis of these 42 cases revealed that in majority of these cases (approx. 52 %), the market price as on the fifteenth day after the closure of offer was substantially (viz. over 20 %) less than the offer price. The analysis revealed that the offers which were over-accepted were those offers where the offer price represented a large premium to the post offer price, and where the potential loss to shareholders who did not receive full acceptance was the highest. Hence the Committee concluded that the fact that most open offers were not over accepted was not a reason to assume that shareholders were not interested in receiving full acceptance of shares tendered in open offers.1.6\tThe Committee is of the view that mandating an open offer to acquire every share tendered by any shareholder in acceptance of the open offer would be equitable, just and fair. Should a shareholder desire to exit a target company at the offer price mandated under the Takeover Regulations, there ought to be no reason for the law to pre-empt him from a complete exit.1.7\tBesides, the obligation under the Takeover Regulations is to only make an ^open offer^ to the shareholders. There is no obligation on the shareholders to sell their shares to the acquirer.1.8\tThe Committee is mindful of an apprehension voiced about the lack of required bank finance presently available to Indian acquirers for Indian acquisitions. Therefore, acquirers instead have to approach diversified public markets or private investors to finance acquisitions. It was pointed out that public market investors are not approached for funds before a transaction is announced for confidentiality reasons  transactions are announced based on a bridge loan, and permanent funding, either from equity markets or public market debt investors like mutual funds and insurance companies, is arranged subsequently. Foreign acquirers may not be subjected to similar regulatory restrictions on access to bank finance under their respective jurisdictions.1.9\tThe Committee is of the view that allowing more flexible norms for grant of loans for strategic investments in Indian listed entities, particularly for funding open offers in deserving cases under the Takeover Regulations is a matter of policy requiringReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 19 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaconsideration by the concerned authorities. This could help create a level playing field for domestic acquirers vis--vis foreign acquirers for speedy deal execution. The case for flexible acquisition financing is reinforced by the fact that the open offers are made in terms of the regulatory framework laid down by SEBI, and therefore such acquisitions would be under regulatory supervision.1.10 The Committee has also recommended measures to enhance the ability to pay for open offers in the form of non-cash consideration (discussed elsewhere in the Report). The Committee reiterates that the philosophy of equitable and fair treatment of all shareholders should have a primacy over other considerations.1.11 The Committee also observed that consistent with the changes that it has recommended in the threshold triggering an open offer, there is very little justification to continue with a restricted offer size that would result in all shareholders not having a right to full exit.1.12 Having considered all relevant factors, the Committee has concluded that there is a very strong case for allowing all public shareholders to obtain a complete exit whenever an open offer is made. This recommendation is based on several aspects including sound conceptual underpinnings, international best practices and feedback from the public.1.13 The Committee also considered whether the offer should be extended to holders of any equity-linked instruments which are not currently eligible for conversion into equity shares as on the expected date of close of the tendering period. The Committee concluded that given the uncertainty about the response to the open offer, any change in terms of equity linked instruments including acceleration of vesting, would not be justified.Committee Recommendation:1.14 The Committee recommends that every open offer pursuant to a substantial acquisition of shares in, or change of control over a target company under the Takeover Regulations ought to be for every share held by all the shareholders of the target company, as on the expected date of the close of the tendering period. Holders of equity-linked instruments eligible to be converted into equity shares prior to the aforementioned date may do so and tender their equity shares in the open offer.(See Regulation 7 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 20 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaMinimum Public Shareholding RequirementsCurrent Provisions:1.15 The Takeover Regulations currently provide that if the acquisition made pursuant to an open offer results in the public shareholding in the target company falling below the minimum level required as per the listing agreement, the acquirer shall take necessary steps to facilitate compliance with the relevant provisions thereof, within the time period specified therein.Committee Deliberations:1.16 An attendant consequence of increasing the open offer size to 100 % of the voting capital of the target company would indeed be that an acquirer may end up acquiring shares in excess of the maximum permissible non-public shareholding of the target company or even the delisting threshold of the target company. The Committee considered this position and concluded that certain corresponding changes are required in the Takeover Regulations to achieve consistency with the proposed new regime of an open offer for 100 % of the voting capital of the target company.1.17 Moreover, there was feedback from various quarters suggesting that the regime for substantial acquisition of shares, takeover of companies and eventual delisting of companies should work in a composite and seamless manner so that M&A activity is transparent and predictable not only for acquirers (who are themselves investors in securities), but also for public shareholders to exit a listed company when a substantial acquisition or a takeover is effected.1.18 The Committee felt that, it would be unfair to require acquirers to necessarily sell-down their shareholding to meet the minimum public shareholding requirements if they have crossed the delisting threshold through an open offer. It would also be onerous to require such an acquirer to make another offer under the Delisting Regulations. The Committee therefore felt that if the acquirer declares his intention to delist the target company, and the shares tendered in response to the open offer enable him to cross the delisting threshold, such a company should be allowed to delist.1.19 In the event of an acquirer crossing the delisting threshold, the Committee also considered the feasibility of adopting the concept of ^squeeze out^ of minority shareholders in the Takeover Regulations on the lines of international practice i.e. conferring the acquirer with a statutory right to acquire minority shareholders on sameReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 21 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaterms when the acquirers shareholding crosses a certain high percentage of the voting capital of the target company. However, the Committee is conscious of the fact that squeeze out can not be legally effected through SEBI regulations in the absence of a statutory provision.1.20 The Committee believes that its recommendation to permit delisting of a company if the holding of the acquirer crosses the delisting threshold via a single open offer is in the interest of investors in securities and the securities market. If the post-open offer holding of the acquirer were to fall short of the delisting threshold, then there should be no scope for delisting under the Takeover Regulations.1.21 Further, the Committee took note of the varying levels of shareholding that the acquirer could end up with on completion of an open offer, and the implications that such variations could have for compliance with minimum public shareholding requirements. For example, if the acquirer were to end up with a holding above the maximum permitted non-public shareholding but below the delisting threshold, the target company would have to eventually become compliant with the minimum public shareholding requirements.1.22 The SCRR requires public shareholding to be at least 25 % (excluding shares held by custodians against which depository receipts have been issued overseas) while the delisting threshold as prescribed by Delisting Regulations is at minimum of 90 % of the total issued shares (excluding the shares which are held by a custodian and against which depository receipts have been issued overseas). It is beyond the scope of the Takeover Regulations to determine such thresholds, and hence there may be situations where the target company would not be compliant with minimum public shareholding and yet not cross the delisting threshold.1.23 In view of the variations and the need to be in compliance with the current regulatory framework regarding listing thresholds, the Committee is of the view that should the acquirer not succeed in getting the response that would take his holding beyond the delisting threshold, the acquirer may either bring down the non-public shareholding within the time permitted, or, proportionately reduce the acquisitions under the open offer and under the agreement which attracted the obligation to make the open offer. The Committee believes that not forcing acquirers to sell-down, and allowing them to proportionately reduce their acquisition balances the interest of the public and the acquirer, in the context of a regime which has a differential delisting threshold and maximum permissible non-public shareholding. Further, such an ability toReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 22 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaproportionately reduce the acquisition under the agreement and the offer is in keeping with the principle of equity, as both the contracting party and public shareholders would have similar levels of acceptance of their respective shareholdings in the company. Such proportionate reduction in acquisitions would not apply to allotments made by the target company that have triggered the open offer, as the Companies Act does not provide for reversal of allotments already made.1.24 The Committee recognized that SEBI has notified the Delisting Regulations to provide a framework for voluntary delisting, and hence has also consciously sought to prevent substantial shareholders from using open offer as a means to delist. The possibility of combining the Delisting Regulations and the Takeover Regulations is also outside the scope of this Committee. The very decision to make a creeping acquisition which does not lead to a change in control, and thereby trigger an open offer would be a voluntary one, and therefore, one ought to differentiate between an open offer triggered by voluntary consolidation and an open offer triggered by a substantial acquisition or a change in control. Therefore, such an avenue for delisting under the Takeover Regulations would be available only in the case of open offers made pursuant to substantial acquisition of shares in, or a change of control over a target company.1.25 The Committee believes that within the constraint of different levels of shareholding threshold as prescribed under different regulations, the framework as suggested would best reconcile various regulatory provisions contained in the Takeover Regulations, Delisting Regulations and the Listing Agreement and the SCRR.Committee Recommendation:1.26 The Committee recommends that the target company should stand delisted, should the acquirer have stated its intention to delist the target company and the response to the open offer is such that the acquirers shareholding crosses the delisting threshold.1.27 The Committee recommends that in the event the shares of the target company stand delisted pursuant to the open offer, every shareholder who has not tendered an acceptance of the open offer shall be entitled to require the acquirer to acquire his shares at the offer price at any time within a period of twelve months from the fifteenth day from the date on which the shares are delisted from the stock exchanges. This exit window would also be available to the holders of all equity-linked instruments in the company. The company and the acquirer shall take necessary stepsReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 23 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiato facilitate the provision of an option to such holders to accelerate the conversion / vesting of such instruments during the period of this exit window.1.28 The Committee also recommends that should the acquirers shareholding reach a level between the maximum permissible non-public shareholding and the delisting threshold, such acquirer be given an option to proportionately reduce the acquisitions. The acquisitions that are proportionately reduced would be those under the open offer, the agreement (if any) and immediate past purchases (except acquisitions due to allotments by the target company). Such reduction would enable the acquirer not to breach the maximum permissible non-public shareholding.(See Regulation 7 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)2.0\tThresholds for Open OffersInitial ThresholdCurrent Provisions:2.1\tThe Takeover Regulations currently provide that if an acquirer acquires or agrees to acquire shares or voting rights such that his voting rights exceed 15 % of the voting capital of the target company, he is required to make an open offer.Committee Deliberations:2.2\tThe Committee observed that the existing threshold of 15 % had been fixed in an environment where the shareholding pattern in corporate India was such that it was possible to control listed companies with holdings as low as 15 %, and therefore the threshold was considered to be a substantial voting power.2.3\tThe Committee also reviewed the recent trends in shareholding pattern of the companies listed on the national stock exchanges, and took into consideration the public comments received in this regard. A significant change in the shareholding pattern in listed companies has been observed over the last few years. The mean and median of promoter shareholdings in the listed companies are currently at 48.9 % and 50.5 % of the total equity capital of the company respectively, and the number of companies declared to be controlled by promoters holding 15 % or less is less than 8.4 %. (See Annexure 2)Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 24 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India2.4\tThe Committee concluded that the existing trigger threshold of 15 % has outlived its contextual relevance and would require an upward revision. The Committee also observed that there are only about 6.1 % companies listed on the BSE where promoter shareholding is between 15 % and 25 %. Hence, the Committee concluded in favor of increasing the initial trigger threshold.2.5\tThe Committee observed that in the UK, the first trigger point is at 30 %. Initial trigger points in other jurisdictions such as Singapore, Hong Kong, EU and South Africa were also found to be in the range of 30 % to 35 %. These trigger levels were set primarily based on the level at which a potential acquirer can exercise de facto positive control over a company, viz. the level at which the potential acquirer is likely to be able to get a majority of votes cast in a general meeting of shareholders.2.6\tIt was observed that despite the increase in the mean level of promoter shareholding, there are a number of prominent companies in India, which are controlled by shareholders holding between 25 % and 30 % of the voting capital of the company. The Committee is of the view that this trend suggests that 25 % is the level at which promoters would be capable of exercising de facto control. Further, in India, the Companies Act recognizes any holding in excess of 25 % as the threshold at which special resolutions can be blocked. Taking into account both the ability of promoters to exercise de facto control at 25 %, and the law governing special resolutions, 30 % threshold would be too high.2.7\tThe Committee felt that 25 % shareholding would be an appropriate level at which a new incumbent shareholder could reasonably expect to exercise positive control in the current environment. Thus the Committee concluded that since a holding level of 25 % permits the exercise of de facto control over a company, this could be fixed as the appropriate open offer trigger threshold in the Indian context.Committee Recommendation:2.8\tThe Committee therefore recommends that the initial acquisition threshold for a mandatory open offer be raised to 25 % of the voting capital of the target company. (See Regulation 3(1) of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 25 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaCreeping AcquisitionsCurrent Provisions:2.9\t\tThe Takeover Regulations currently provide that if an acquirer already holds morethan 15 % but less than 55 %, he may acquire additional shares carrying not more than five % of voting rights within a financial year without having to make an open offer.2.10 Further, where the holding is above 55 % but less than 75 %, a one-time allowance to increase their shareholding by 5 % through market purchases or pursuant to a Buy back by the target company, without having to make an open offer, has been permitted since October 28, 2008 provided that post acquisition holding of acquirer does not go beyond 75 %.Committee Deliberations:2.11 The Committee observed that at present the existing limit on additional acquisitions for consolidation purposes within a financial year (generally termed as ^creeping acquisitions^) under the Takeover Regulations has been set at 5 %.2.12 The Committee explored the desirability of introducing another open offer trigger at 50 % after the initial trigger at 25 %. In such a scenario, creeping acquisition would be restricted to a nominal/low level between the initial threshold and 50 % and would be relatively easier after 50 %. However, the Committee also observed that more than 50 % of the companies listed on BSE have promoter shareholding less than 50 % and approximately 27 % companies have promoter shareholding less than 35 %. Such a regime, while making it restrictive for new acquirers obtaining control, may impose an unduly heavy burden on the existing promoters of companies in their consolidation efforts.2.13 During deliberations, it was felt that, a holding of more than 50 % does not seem to confer a significant and material advantage warranting a full-scale open offer, given that even shareholders with slightly less than 50 % would have de facto control in almost all instances. In addition, another open offer trigger at 50 % coupled with a regulatory requirement to have minimum 25 % public shareholding would result in avoidable complexities.2.14 The Committee also felt that the current threshold beyond which creeping acquisition is no longer permitted is not appropriate in the context of a mandatory 100 % openReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 26 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaoffer and hence recommended that creeping acquisition of 5 % per annum be allowed up to the maximum permissible non-public shareholding limit.2.15 The Committee was also mindful of the fact that as per the current Regulations, a voluntary open offer has to be for a minimum of 20 %. The Committee debated the size of the voluntary open offer (discussed elsewhere in this report) and decided to reduce the size of the voluntary open offer to a minimum level of 10 %.2.16 The Committee underscored the fact that the creeping acquisition route is meant to facilitate consolidation by persons already in control or holding substantial number of shares. Therefore, the Committee does not find it necessary to disturb the current policy in this regard in that gross purchases (ignoring any sales or dilution of stake due to equity issuances in which the existing shareholder did not participate) would count towards ascertaining if this limit has been reached. However, in case of situations where the acquisition is carried out through the issue of new shares by the company (whether through a preferential allotment solely to the substantial shareholder, or through simultaneous preferential allotment both to the existing substantial shareholder and others, or through subscription by a existing substantial shareholder in a public or rights offering), the percentage of shares acquired would be reckoned as the difference between the post issue and pre issue shareholding of the substantial shareholder, rather than based on the number of shares issued to such substantial shareholder.Committee Recommendation:2.17 The Committee recommends a creeping acquisition limit of 5 % per financial yearcomputed on a gross basis for all shareholders holding more than 25 % so long as themaximum non-public shareholding limit is not breached.(See Regulation 3(2) of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)Voluntary OffersCurrent Provisions:2.18 Currently, the Takeover Regulations provide for consolidation of shareholding by an acquirer who is desirous of maximizing his shareholding without breaching the minimum public shareholding requirements. The offer size for an open offer underReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 27 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiathis provision is the lower of 20 % or the maximum permissible acquisition without breaching the minimum public shareholding requirement.Committee Deliberations:2.19 The Committee observed that with the proposed increase in the open offer size to 100 % of the voting capital of the target company, there is a need to provide for flexibility to acquirers to voluntarily make open offers outside the mandatory public offer requirements. The Committee felt that voluntary offers are an important means for substantial shareholders to consolidate their stake and therefore recognized the need to introduce a specific framework for such open offers. However, to discourage non-serious voluntary offers, the Committee decided to set a minimum offer size of 10 %.2.20 The Committee also observed that, inasmuch as the voluntary open offer is permitted as an exception to the general rule on the offer size, the ability to voluntarily make an open offer should not be available if in the proximate past, any of such persons have made acquisitions within the creeping acquisition limits permitted under the Regulations. Similarly, such an acquirer should be prohibited from making acquisitions outside the open offer during the offer period, and should also be prohibited from any further acquisitions for six months after the open offer. Also, such an offer should not lead to breach of the maximum permissible non-public shareholding.Committee Recommendation:2.21 The Committee therefore recommends that acquirers collectively holding shares entitling them to exercise 25 % or more voting rights in the target company may voluntarily make an open offer to consolidate their shareholding. The Committee has proposed a minimum open offer size of 10 % consistent with the rationale of consolidation option outside the creeping route. Voluntary offers should not, however, be of a size that could lead to breach of the maximum permissible non-public shareholding.(See Regulation 6 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 28 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India3.0\tControlCurrent Provisions:3.1\tThe Takeover Regulations currently provide for inclusive definition of \"control\". It is provided under the Takeover Regulations that control shall include the right to appoint majority of directors or to control the management or policy decisions exercisable by a person or persons acting individually or in concert, directly or indirectly, including by virtue of their shareholding or management rights or shareholder agreements or voting agreements or in any other manner.Committee Deliberations:3.2\tThe concept of \"control\" was deliberated in the context of the public comments received in this regard. Diverse perspectives on whether affirmative rights relating to governance of a listed company (whereby a party to the agreement could object to a specific set of decisions) ipso facto constituted \"control\" or otherwise were also debated.3.3\tIt was observed that the same set of provisions could vary in its import and reach across different target companies depending on the facts, circumstances and nature of each target company. In any event, the Committee felt that the existence or nonexistence of \"control\" over a listed company would be a question of fact, or at best a mixed question of fact and law, to be answered on a case to case basis. The Committee also recognized that any blanket provision whereby a right to say \"no\" is in all circumstances deemed to either constitute \"control\" or not to constitute \"control\" may be liable to misuse.3.4\tThe Committee was conscious of the interpretation of such provision in the facts and circumstances of a specific case by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, and observed that an appeal against such decision was pending before the Supreme Court of India.3.5\tIn the circumstances, given the case-specific nature of \"control\" as a concept, the Committee decided to refrain from stipulating whether the power to say \"no\" would constitute \"control\" for purposes of the Takeover Regulations. Whether a person has acquired control by virtue of affirmative rights would therefore have to be discerned from the facts and circumstances surrounding each case.3.6\tThe Committee observed that it was desirable to underline and emphasize that acquisition of de facto control, and not just de jure control should expressly trigger anReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 29 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaopen offer obligation. The Committee also felt it desirable to clarify that merely by virtue of holding the position of a director or officer of a target company, such a person ought not to be regarded as being in control over the target company.Committee Recommendations:3.7\tThe Committee recommends that the definition of \"control\" be modified to include \"ability\" in addition to \"right\" to appoint majority of the directors or to control the management or policy decisions would constitute control. It is also clarified that a director or officer of the target company would not be regarded as being in control merely by virtue of holding such position.(See Regulation 4 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)4.0\tOffer PriceCurrent Provisions:4.1\tThe Takeover Regulations currently provide the parameters to be considered for determining the minimum offer price depending on whether or not the shares of the target company are \"frequently traded\" (shares which have annualized trading volume of 5 % or more of the listed share capital during a period of 6 calendar months preceding the month in which the public announcement is made). Such parameters for frequently traded shares include the price under the agreement for acquisition that attracted the open offer, any price paid by the acquirer or persons acting in concert during a 26-week period preceding the public announcement (termed as the \"look back period\"), and the historical market average price of the shares for a proximate past period.4.2\tFor \"infrequently traded\" shares, the Takeover Regulations require the computation of the offer price on the basis of financial parameters such as return on net worth, industry price-earnings multiples and the like, apart from any price actually paid by the acquirer or persons acting in concert during the look back period, or in the transaction that triggers the open offer obligation.4.3\tThe Takeover Regulations also require addition to the open offer price, of any amount paid towards non-compete fee in excess of 25 % of the open offer price.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 30 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaCommittee Deliberations:4.4\tThe Committee observed that the Takeover Regulations have historically regulated the minimum price at which an open offer is required to be made and was unanimous in its view that there is a continued need to stipulate a minimum price that ought to be offered to the shareholders. In fact, one of the fundamental principles underlying the Takeover Regulations is to give public shareholders an exit on terms not inferior to the terms obtained by a substantial shareholder from the acquirer for his large shareholding. Further, the minimum price should also prevent acquirers from building a stake over a period of time without offering that price to shareholders in the offer.4.5\tHowever, there was considerable deliberation as to whether the price that must be payable for an open offer should be one that is ^not inferior\" to that received by substantial shareholders / paid by the acquirer or should the price that must be payable be a ^fair price\". In arriving at a decision on this aspect, the Committee went back to the fundamental objectives of the Takeover Regulations, and finally concluded that the Takeover Regulations need to preserve the concept of equity for all shareholders, and in that context, the offer price payable to public shareholders should be ^not inferior\" to that paid for substantial shareholders. As there is no justification for a premium payable to substantial shareholders, there is also no justification for any regulated mechanism or premium payable to public shareholders.4.6\tIn the context of the foregoing, the Committee examined whether the price parameters currently applicable have served well, and whether any revision is warranted in any of them in the face of the regulatory experience over the years.4.7\tMarket Price based parameters for frequently traded shares4.7.1\tThe Committee considered whether a market-price based parameter was at all fair or appropriate for pricing open offers, particularly when the transaction that triggers an open offer itself prices the share specifically. In other words, if parties to a transaction actually were contracting a specific negotiated price, the issue that arises is whether it would be fair or appropriate or equitable to require an open offer to be made a price different from such price.4.7.2\tThe Committee observed that most jurisdictions did not use market price parameters at all in regulating the minimum offer price i.e. most of the European Union, most of Asia and other jurisdictions which the CommitteeReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 31 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaconsidered in its deliberations. However, the Committee noted that Germany is one major jurisdiction that uses a market-price-based parameter (volume-weighted average) for determining the offer price. The Committee also observed that the price discovered in the market and the price paid in M&A transactions were not necessarily consistent.4.7.3\tThe Committee also observed that reliance on a historical price averagedistorted the value of the shares and such an average was not reflective of the prevailing market price. The Committee examined data on spot price movements compared with the 26 week average, which showed that at times, the market price parameter mandates excessively large premia to spot prices. A chart illustrating such a feature on the basis of the SENSEX (which is typically less volatile than individual stocks, and hence would understate the impact of this parameter) over a period of 5 years is annexed at Annexure 3.4.7.4\tAs may be observed from the aforesaid chart, the 26 week average candiverge considerably from the spot price on the date of announcement of an offer and such a distortion would impact the ability to strike M&A transactions in bear markets, e.g. there were periods in the 2008-09 bear market when the 26 week average price was over 60 % above the spot price for the SENSEX. Further, for several individual stocks, the 26-week average often implies an even larger premium to the prevailing market price. What this meant that even if acquirers were willing to pay a 10-20 % premium to spot prices to carry out M&A transactions, they would be regulated by a regime that requires minimum offer prices that are as high as 60 % above the spot price. Hence, such an M&A transaction would not take place, and such a regulation would have the impact of being detrimental to all shareholders, including public shareholders. Also, in bull markets, the 26-week average was significantly below the prevailing market price, rendering the parameter irrelevant, as acquirers tend to be guided by the spot prices when making a decision.4.7.5\tThe Committee also examined if the two-week average formula should beretained. It was found that the two week average at announcement for the SENSEX is much closer to the spot price. However, it was found that the price at the time of completion of the open offer diverges materially from the two-week average at the time of the public announcement  the two-Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 32 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaweek average thus represents an almost unscientific random variable. A chart illustrating this phenomenon is annexed at Annexure 4. What this really meant was that given the timelines for making an offer (75 days), the 2-week price at the time of the public announcement also diverges significantly from the market prices at the time of closure of the offer, which is when shareholders make a decision whether or not to tender in an offer.4.7.6\tThe Committee also commissioned a study to explore as to how often themarket price parameter had ended up as the actual offer price. An analysis of the historical open offer data showed that among the offers which were triggered by share acquisition agreements, the price discovered through the market price parameter ended up as the offer price only in a small percentage of open offers (30 %). Also, less than half of the where shares were frequently traded were made based on the market price parameter (approx. 35 %). In all other cases, a higher price was offered as a result of the other more relevant parameters mentioned in Regulation 20(4). Please see Annexure 5 for a detailed analysis.4.7.7\tMembers of the Committee stated that eliminating this parameter would bewell-advised since, rather than delivering substantial benefits to investors, this parameter could be a potential dampener for M&A activity. Besides, it was felt that it would be inequitable and unfair to require a price to be paid under the open offer that is different from the principal triggering transaction. Generally if the market price formula were to lead to a value greater than what a potential acquirer is willing to pay, in most cases, the potential acquirer would either drop the deal or implement any other legitimate deal structure that would not attract the Takeover Regulations. All of the foregoing argues for the market-price parameter being dropped, particularly for direct acquisitions where the price based on other parameters is easily discernible. This principle is also consistent with the principle of equity dictated by a 100% offer regime, and the further refinements suggested in the following sub-sections.4.7.8\tHowever, the Committee also considered the comments from the publicshareholders, which seemed to favour a continued regime of minimum price under an offer to be linked to a market price parameter. There also were apprehensions that our corporate governance framework, thoughReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 33 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiasignificantly improved especially for larger companies, is not yet evolved for the entire listed company universe, and hence the linked with a market price parameter should remain.4.7.9\tThus, the Committee believes that the Takeover Regulations should make an eventual transition to a regime, in which the offer price has no linkage with the market price parameter. However, in the interim the Committee concluded that a linkage with the market price parameter be maintained for the current draft of the Takeover Regulations.4.7.10 While considering the continued market price linkage, the Committee concluded (for reasons mentioned earlier), that the 26-week average is too long a period to consider and that a 2-week average is a too volatile period to consider. The Committee considered 4-week and 12-week averages i.e. 20 and 60 trading day averages in its consideration set to arrive at the optimum period for the market price linkage, and data for 46 randomly selected companies (from the top 1000 by market capitalization) for the last 3 years is presented in Annexure 6. While the 4-week average was closer to the spot price, the Committee felt that it faced issue of higher volatility, similar to the 2-week average.4.7.11 Another change the Committee has proposed is the use of volume-weighted average price (VWAP) in lieu of the average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices /daily intra-day high and low prices of shares under the existing Regulations, since the daily volume weighted average price data are currently readily available. Use of VWAP would ensure that the resultant price is more representative and eliminates the outlier effects of high and low prices and is a more accurate determinant of the prices at which shares are actually transacted.4.7.12 Based on the data and deliberations, the Committee concluded on using the 60 trading day VWAP as a market price parameter, and recommends that this be incorporated in the Takeover Regulations, with a clear view to doing away with this parameter as soon as practicable.4.8\tLook-back parameter4.8.1\tAs per the current Takeover Regulations the look-back clause requires the acquirer to take into account the highest price paid by him or by personsReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 34 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaacting in concert, over a period of twenty-six weeks prior to the date of the public announcement.4.8.2\tAn examination of the relevant provisions in other jurisdictions suggests that such a look-back period ranges from three months (in the case of voluntary offers in Singapore and Hong Kong) to twelve months (United Kingdom).4.8.3\tIt is felt that a look-back period longer than the currently applicable 26-week period would ensure that an acquirer does not get to postpone the public announcement at a marginal carrying cost, just to overcome paying the public shareholder the price he has actually paid in the proximate past. A longer look-back period thus would make it more expensive to defer the public announcement intended by the acquirer. Therefore, after debating various possible look-back periods, the Committee concluded that investor interest would be best served if the acquirer has to pay the highest of:i.\tThe 52 week volume-weighted average price for acquisitions carried out by the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him (whether already paid or agreed to be paid), orii.\tThe highest price paid (or agreed to be paid) by the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him, in the 26 weeks preceding the public announcement.4.9\tNon Compete Fees4.9.1\tMost takeover regulations do not contain any express provisions about treatment of non-compete fees in negotiated contracts that trigger a tender offer. However, there are jurisdictions that require the addition to the offer price of any consideration paid and couched in any form in concurrent and collateral transactions. In India, a tolerance limit of twenty-five % on non-compete payments was brought in as a measure of curbing the practice of paying large non-compete payments, outside the share price.4.9.2\tThe Committee considered the argument for retaining a non-compete payment from the selling shareholders perspective to the effect that the non-compete terms constitute a distinct benefit which the selling shareholder is conferring to the acquirer  which needs to be separately compensated for, as this is distinct from the price for the shares which must be paid to all shareholders.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 35 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India4.9.3\tThe Committee also considered the alternate view that it is very difficult toassess whether such non-compete consideration is reasonable, and that such payments may therefore be a disguise for making payments to controlling shareholders without paying the same to the public shareholders. The Committee also felt that there was a strong merit in the view that non-compete fee, if any, should accrue to the company and not to one group of shareholders as this is in the nature of compensation for loss of potential value on account of opportunity sacrificed. The Committee also debated whether it would be fair to allow payment of a control premium solely to large shareholders. The Committee noted that control was an incidental benefit arising out of share ownership. Based on an examination of the equities and merits involved, as also the law in other jurisdictions, and market realities, it was decided that such a payment would not be fair to minority shareholders.4.9.4\tThe Committee concluded that in keeping with the spirit of equal treatmentfor all shareholders, and the scope for abuse of non-compete payments, the Takeover Regulations ought to be explicit that consideration paid for the shares in any form to the selling shareholder and his affiliates, concurrent with the purchase of shares, whether termed as \"control premium\", or \"non-compete fees\" or otherwise must be added to the negotiated price per share for the purpose of determining open offer pricing.4.9.5\tThe Committee concluded that once the extant exemption in respect of non-compete fee is deleted from the Takeover Regulations, and it is clearly articulated that apart from the share acquisition agreement, consideration in any form inclusive of all ancillary and collateral agreements shall form part of the negotiated price, it is in the selling shareholders interests to ensure that the negotiated price truly reflects the value of the scrip fairly. Since this negotiated price in any case would be one of the parameters for fixing the offer price, if such price were higher than other proposed parameters, all shareholders will get the same negotiated price.4.10 Miscellaneous4.10.1 The Committee also recommends that the acquirer as well as PACs shouldbe prohibited from acquiring any shares in the target company during the 26Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 36 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaweeks following the completion of the open offer. This safe-guard is also aimed at ensuring that the acquirer does not under-price the offer and instead acquire shares later at a higher price.4.10.2 The Committee took note of circular dated May 4, 2010 issued by the RBI stipulating that transfers of listed shares between persons resident outside India and persons resident in India ought not to be at a price lower than the preferential allotment price arrived at in terms of the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations. The Committee noted that such a position may render takeovers of Indian listed companies expensive for foreign acquirers and also restrict the ability of Indian acquirers to take over Indian companies owned by foreigners. Since the Takeover Regulations seek to stipulate and enforce fair value for the M&A transaction, it is but appropriate that the same fair value criteria are adopted for all other regulations including exchange controls so as to bring about regulatory consistency. The Committee therefore recommends that SEBI may like to take this up suitably with the RBI.4.10.3 The Committee reviewed the data on trading volumes of companies listed on BSE and NSE, based on data compiled from Capitaline, and noted that about 70 % of the companies have trading volumes in excess of 10 % of their share capital.Committee Recommendation:4.11 The Committee therefore recommends that the minimum offer price for directacquisitions should be the highest of:(a)\tthe highest negotiated price per share of the target company for any acquisition under the agreement attracting the obligation to make a public announcement of an open offer;(b)\tthe volume-weighted average price paid or payable for any acquisition, whether by the acquirer or by any person acting in concert with him during the fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date of the public announcement; and(c)\tthe highest price paid or payable for any acquisition, whether by the acquirer or by any person acting in concert with him during the twenty-six weeks immediately preceding the date of the public announcement; andReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 37 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India(d) the volume-weighted average market price, for frequently traded shares, during 60 trading days immediately preceding the date of the public announcement, computed based on market prices on the stock exchange where the shares of the company are most frequently traded during that period.4.12 The Committee recommends that frequently traded shares should now be defined as shares which have a trading volume of 10 % or more of the total number of shares during a period of 12 calendar months preceding the month in which the public announcement is made.4.13 In addition, the Committee also recommends that the clause relating to non-compete fee be deleted from the Takeover Regulations, and any consideration paid in any form inclusive of all ancillary and collateral agreements shall form part of the negotiated price.(See Regulation 8 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)5.0\tIndirect AcquisitionsTrigger for indirect acquisitionsCurrent Provisions:5.1\tThe Takeover Regulations currently provide that acquirer has to make an open offer for shares of the target company when there is direct or indirect change of control of the target company irrespective of any direct acquisition of shares of the target company. The regulations also provide for deferment of open offer obligations till consummation of the original transaction.Committee Deliberations:5.2\tThe provisions of the Takeover Regulations are attracted upon acquisition of shares or voting rights in, or control over a target company regardless of whether such acquisitions are made directly, or are consequential to an acquisition of an entity other than the target company. There has been considerable debate as to whether the obligation to make an open offer for the target company should be attracted only when the target company represents a material or substantial component of, or the raison detre of the primary acquisition.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 38 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India5.3\tThe question whether primary transactions ought not to trigger open offer obligations unless the indirectly-acquired target company represented a material component of the primary transaction, particularly in the case of global multi-national acquisitions, was also debated by the Committee in detail. One view was that indirect acquisitions should trigger open offers only if the indirectly held target company was a material part of the assets of the parent. This would be in keeping with the practice in most international jurisdictions.5.4\tAnother view was to have a flexible approach depending on the type and underlying nature of each such transaction. Cases of indirect acquisition could typically fall under the following 3 categories, viz. (i) cases where the target company is a ^significant component^ of the primary transaction; (ii) cases where the target company should be regarded as an intended object or material part of the main acquisition; and (iii) cases where the target company is a non-material and unintended, incidental consequence of the primary acquisition.5.5\tThe Committee believes that if there is a change of control over a listed company, or if an acquirer indirectly acquires the ability to direct the exercise of voting power in excess of the thresholds specified for attracting open offer obligations, there ought to be no differentiation in the imposition of the obligation to make an open offer. An analysis of companies listed in India, whose controlling interest is held by another listed Indian company or an international company is presented in Annexure 7.5.6\tThe Committee observed that most Indian companies would fall under category (iii) above (viz. would be non-material or incidental targets), and if such companies were to be exempted from an obligation to make an open offer, the shareholders of such target companies would be deprived of their legitimate right to get an exit opportunity despite the occurrence of a change in control. Further the Committee also believed that if there is a change of control over a company listed on a stock exchange, or if an acquirer indirectly acquires the ability to direct the exercise of voting power in excess of the thresholds specified for attracting open offer obligations, there ought to be no differentiation in the imposition of the obligation to make an open offer. Such a distinction would have the effect of giving large transactions the benefit of an exemption from an open offer and would impose such an obligation in a discriminatory manner only on small transactions.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 39 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India5.7\tAfter taking into account the above factors, the Committee by majority view, felt that materiality thresholds for attracting an open offer obligation in the case of indirect acquisitions ought not to be recommended.Committee Recommendation:5.8\tThe Committee recommends that irrespective of whether the target company is material to the parent transaction, open offer obligations have to be triggered. Where a change in control over the target company occurs, shareholders of the target company ought to rightfully get an adequate exit opportunity.(See Regulation 5 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)Timing and Offer PriceCurrent Provisions:5.9\tThe Takeover Regulations currently provide that in case of indirect acquisition of shares or change of control, a public announcement may be made by the acquirer at any time from the date of the initial announcement of the intention to acquire or entering in to the acquisition agreement, until completion of three months after the consummation of such acquisition or change in control or restructuring of the parent or the company holding shares of or control over the target company.5.10 The Takeover Regulations currently do not differentiate between open offers arising due to direct acquisitions vis--vis indirect acquisitions for computation of offer price and the same offer price formula prescribed for direct acquisitions is used for indirect acquisitions as well, and the practice is to compute the offer price as of the date of the announcement of primary acquisition and as of the date of the public announcement for the target company, whichever is higher.Committee Deliberations:5.11 The current Takeover Regulations provide for a leeway of up to three months after consummation of the parent acquisition for a public announcement of an open offer for the indirectly-acquired target company to be made. However, shareholders would have already been given advance notice that an open offer is imminent in such a situation, except if the parent acquisition is withdrawn for some reason. Since the computation of the offer price for such an imminent open offer includes a 2-weekReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 40 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaprice formula, the Committee noticed some situations in which the market price saw a steady rise from the date of announcement of the primary acquisition until the date of the eventual public announcement.5.12 The market price for such indirectly acquired target company would naturally be rising in anticipation of the impending open offer on the knowledge that market price would dictate the minimum offer price. The Committee concluded that in such situations, the balance is unfairly loaded against the acquirer. As the acquirer may not be in a position to launch the open offer until the primary acquisition is consummated, the market price of the target company could end up spiraling upwards before the open offer is eventually announced.5.13 Moreover, the acquisitions between the two dates (date of announcement of the primary acquisition and the eventual date of public announcement) may fall outside the relevant look-back period. Therefore, even an actual acquisition may not get factored into the computation of the minimum offer price.5.14 The Committee recognizes that although materiality is not a very important aspect for determining whether an open offer is required to be made, the materiality criterion is important for ascribing a value to the target company. The Committee is therefore of the view that in an indirect acquisition, the target company may have indeed formed a sizeable component of the primary transaction and may have played a role in the negotiations for such transaction, and yet, the negotiated price for the primary transaction may not specifically ear-mark the value of the target company.5.15 The Committee believes there is a need to ascribe a separate value to the target company in situations where the target company forms a significant part of the primary transaction. The value so ascribed would help in determining a fair offer price in such cases. .5.16 Further, to avoid the risk of transactions being structured as indirect acquisitions merely to avoid the price computation methodology and the open offer process prescribed for direct acquisitions, the Committee decided that where the proportionate net asset value, or the sales turnover, or the market capitalization of the indirectly-acquired listed company represents more than 80 % of the net asset value, sales turnover or the deal value for the parent transaction, the acquirer must specify the value of the stake in the Indian company that has been factored in and the basis of such valuation and the Takeover Regulations would treat such acquisitions as if they were direct acquisitions, with no leeway on time for making the public announcement.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 41 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India5.17 The Committee is of the view that certain flexibility needs to be provided for indirect acquisitions where the target company is not a significant part of the primary transaction. In cases where the target company is not a significant part of the primary transaction, the public announcement (required to be made on the same terms as if it were a case of direct acquisition) may be made within four business days of the date on which the primary acquisition was announced in the public domain or any agreement was entered into. This shall be followed with detailed public statement to be issued within five business days of the date of completion of the primary acquisition.5.18 However, as the acquirer would be fixing the price payable for the offer as on the date of the primary acquisition, and would have the benefit of delaying payment to the shareholders (due to time lag in completing the primary acquisition), all the shareholders tendering shares in the open offer would need to be compensated by way of an increase in the offer price at the rate of [10 %] per annum for the period between the announcement of primary acquisition and date on which the detailed public statement is actually made if such period is more than five business days.5.19 Where the proportionate net asset value, or the sales turnover, or the market capitalization of the indirectly-acquired listed company represents more than 15 % of the net asset value, or the sales turnover, or the deal value for the parent acquisition, the acquirer shall be required to compute and disclose the per share value of the target company taken into account for the primary acquisition, and the basis for such valuation. Where such a proportion is less than 15 % on all the parameters, then such a target company would be considered to be a non-material part of the primary transaction, without the requirement to determine an attribution of value of the indirectly-acquired target company.Committee Recommendation:5.20 With regard to the pricing of open offers triggered on account of indirect acquisitions,the Committee recommends the following:(a) Where the proportionate net asset value, or the sales turnover, or the market capitalization of the indirectly-acquired listed company represents more than 80 % of the net asset value, sales turnover or the deal value for the parent business or company, the acquirer must specify the value of the stake in the Indian company and the basis ofReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 42 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiasuch valuation that would have been factored in, and the Takeover Regulations would treat such acquisitions as if they were direct acquisitions in all respects.(b) For indirectly acquired target companies, the minimum offer price ought to be the highest of:1) The highest negotiated price per share, if any, of the target company for any acquisition under the agreement attracting the obligation to make a public announcement of an open offer;i. Where the proportionate net asset value, or the sales turnover, or the market capitalization of the indirectly acquired listed company represents more than 15 % of the net asset value, or the sales turnover, or the deal value for the parent business or company, the acquirer shall be required to compute and disclose the per share value of the target company taken into account for the acquisition of the parent business or company and the basis of such valuation.ii. Where the proportionate net asset value, or the sales turnover, or the market capitalization of the indirectly acquired listed company represents less than 15 % of the net asset value, or the sales turnover, or the deal value for the parent business or company, the acquirer shall not be necessarily required to make the computation as above, but to factor in the same if the same has been carried out.2) The volume-weighted average price paid or payable for any acquisition, whether by the acquirer or by any person acting in concert with him during the fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date on which the intention or the decision to make the primary acquisition was announced in the public domain or any agreement was entered into;3) The highest price paid or payable for any acquisition, whether by the acquirer or by any person acting in concert with him during the twenty-six weeks immediately preceding the date on which the intention or the decision to make the primary acquisition was announced in the public domain or any agreement was entered into; andReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 43 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaThe highest price paid or payable for any acquisition, whether by the acquirer or by any person acting in concert with him between the date on which the intention or the decision to make the primary acquisition was announced in the public domain or any agreement was entered into and the date of the public announcement;(c) For frequently traded shares, the volume-weighted average market price on the stock exchange for a period of 60 trading days preceding the date on which the intention or the decision to make the primary acquisition was announced in the public domain or any agreement was entered into, as traded on the stock exchange where the maximum volume of trading in the shares of the target company are recorded during such period.(d) The price offered as of the date of public announcement (to be calculated as detailed above) shall have to be increased by 10 % per annum for the period between the announcement of primary acquisition and date on which the detailed public statement is actually made.5.21 With regard to the timing of the issue of public announcement, the Committee recommends that for transactions where the proportionate net asset value, or the sales turnover, or the market capitalization of the indirectly-acquired listed company represents more than 80 % of the net asset value, sales turnover or the deal value for the parent business or company, the public announcement be made on the earlier of the date on which the intention or the decision to make the primary acquisition was announced in the public domain or any agreement was entered into. In all other cases, the public announcement can be made within four business days of such date, and in such cases the detailed public statement should be issued within five business days of the consummation of the primary acquisition.(See Regulations 8 and 13 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)6.0\tWithdrawal of open offerCurrent Provisions:6.1\tThe Takeover Regulations currently provide that no open offer, once made, shall be withdrawn except under the following circumstances:(a)\tthe statutory approval(s) required have been refused;Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 44 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India(b)\tthe sole acquirer, being a natural person, has died;(c)\tsuch circumstances as in the opinion of SEBI merits withdrawalCommittee Deliberations:6.2\tOrdinarily, once an open offer is made, its inexorable conclusion ought to be the completion of the open offer. However, there could be circumstances where the open offer cannot be completed. These circumstances can be classified into two types viz. (a) where it is rendered impossible for the open offer to continue  for example, death of an acquirer who is an individual, or rejection of any statutory approval required for the offer (as provided for currently); and (b) non-attainment of any condition stipulated in the agreement that attracted the open offer obligation for reasons beyond the control of the acquirer, resulting in the agreement itself not being acted upon.6.3\tThere was extensive debate within the Committee about whether non-attainment of conditions other than regulatory approvals should be permitted as a reason for withdrawal of the offer. The Committee examined regulations in other jurisdictions and found that in certain jurisdictions such as Australia, Singapore, Germany, US and UK, the acquirers are allowed to clearly specify conditions to the offer, and to withdraw the offer if these conditions are not met, and if the triggering agreement was not acted upon.6.4\tThe Committee believes that it is important to permit withdrawal of the open offer in such circumstances. To build safeguards, the Committee recommends that the conditions subject to which the triggering agreement was executed, the failure of which would result in such agreement not being acted upon, ought to be fully and fairly disclosed upfront when the detailed public statement is made. Besides, the non-attainment of such a condition ought to be for reasons outside the control of the acquirer. Moreover, the acquisition triggering the open offer ought not to be effected in order to be eligible for withdrawal.Committee Recommendation:6.5\tThe Committee recommends that, in addition to the grounds currently existing, an open offer may be withdrawn where any condition stipulated in the agreement for acquisition attracting the obligation to make the open offer is not met for reasons outside the reasonable control of the acquirer, and such agreement is rescinded,Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 45 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiasubject to such conditions having been disclosed in the detailed public statement andthe letter of offer.(See Regulation 23 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)7.0\tCompeting OffersCurrent Provisions:7.1\tThe Takeover Regulations currently provide the opportunity to any person other than the acquirer to make a competing offer within 21 days of the public announcement of the first offer. The Takeover Regulations also provide that any competitive offer by an acquirer shall be for such number of shares which, when taken together with shares held by him shall be at least equal to the holding of the first bidder including the number of shares for which the present offer by the first bidder has been made.Committee Deliberations:7.2\tThe concept of competing offers, (current Takeover Regulations term these as ^competitive bids^), was deliberated at length by the Committee. The discussions focused on a number of areas relevant to competing offers like timelines, offer size, reasonable obligations and restrictions on the competing acquirers and on the target company, parameters of the open offers that may be revised, a cut-off time for such revisions, withdrawal of competing offers, and inter se transfer of shares among the bidders after completion of the competing offers.7.3\tThe Committee recognized that the intent behind such provisions is to achieve orderly competition between acquirers vying for the same target company. The Committee was clear that competing offers if undertaken in a fair, transparent and equitable manner would be in the interests of the shareholders at large and therefore need be facilitated. However, it was also felt that certain reasonable restrictions should be placed on the target company as well as on the bidders so as to make the process more robust.7.4\tThe Committee is of the view that the present period of 21 days for making a competitive bid is short. One should also ensure that the permitted time period is not so long as to result in prolonged uncertainty. Further, after the expiry of the period within which a competing offer may be made, no person should be permitted to eitherReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 46 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiamake an open offer or enter into a transaction that would trigger an open offer until expiry of the offer period.7.5\tThe Committee recommends that the general rule on offer size should be applicable to competing offers as well. The Committee however considered whether any deviation is warranted where the first offer were a voluntary offer with restrictions on the offer size, i.e. a maximum of such number of shares as would keep the acquirer within the maximum permissible non-public shareholding. If there were a competing offer after a voluntary offer is made, the acquirer who has made a voluntary offer ought to be given a chance to enhance the size of his open offer to a full offer and stand released from the restrictions on market purchases so that he could effectively compete with the competing acquirer.7.6\tThe question of whether intermediate offer sizes need be permitted for defensive counter offers was considered by the Committee. However, the Committee felt that such a position would lead to differential treatment of competing offers with no rationale therefor. It was also considered important to ensure that an open offer made in response to an existing open offer ought not to be considered as a voluntary offer. Therefore, once an open offer is made for a target company, an acquirer making a competing offer ought not to be able to make a smaller-sized open offer, and should be required to compete on even terms.7.7\tThe Committee discussed the possibility of allowing an acquirer to withdraw an open offer made to shareholders of the target company, upon a competing offer being made. The Committee felt that it is in best interests of the shareholders of the target company that they get to decide the controlling acquirer from amongst the competing acquirers and therefore the Committee decided that existing open offers should continue to be valid. At the same time, the Committee also observed that in case of a split decision by shareholders of the target company, for efficient and smooth future running of business operations, it is in best interests of the target company that competing acquirers be given an opportunity to exit in favour of any one competing acquirer within certain time limitations. Shares held by one of the competing acquirers can be tendered in the offer made by the other competing acquirer. However, shares acquired by such competing acquirer in the open offer can not be tendered during the offer period and hence the Committee felt that a mechanism should be provided to enable the competing acquirer to sell such shares to the other competing acquirer within certain specified time without triggering further open offer obligations.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 47 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaCommittee Recommendation:7.8\tTherefore, with a view to rationalize the time lines for making a competing offer, the Committee recommends that a competing offer may be made within 15 business days from the date of the original detailed public statement instead of 21 calendar days from the date of the original public announcement. No further offer should be allowed to be made after the expiry of the said period of 15 business days until the completion of all the competing offers.7.9\tAn open offer made by a competing acquirer shall not be regarded as a voluntary open offer and therefore all provisions of Takeover Regulations, including relating to offer size, shall apply accordingly.7.10 The Committee also recommends that an acquirer, who has made a competing offer, shall be entitled to acquire the shares acquired by the other competing acquirers in their respective competing open offers within 21 business days of the expiry of the offer period without attracting an obligation to make another open offer. However, such an acquisition shall not be made at a price exceeding the offer price in the competing offer made by the acquirer who buys shares in such transaction. Moreover, such an acquisition ought not to take the shareholding of the acquirer beyond the maximum permissible non-public shareholding limit.7.11 The Committee also considered certain other conditions specific to competing offers and recommended the following:a. During the pendency of competing offers, no appointment of additional directors ought to be made on the board of directors of the target company.b. The ability of an acquirer to proportionately reduce his acquisitions such that theholding does not exceed the maximum permissible non-public shareholding ought not to be available where competing offers are underway. This is critical to ensure that competing acquirers compete on an identical end-objective and shareholders are truly able to compare them on the offer price.c. Unless the open offer first made is an open offer conditional as to the minimum level of acceptances, no open offer made by a competing acquirer may be conditional as to the minimum level of acceptances.d. The schedule of activities and the tendering period for all competing offers shall be carried out with identical timelines and the dates for tendering shares shall beReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 48 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiarevised to the dates for tendering shares in acceptance of the competing offer lastmade.(See Regulation 20 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)8.0\tObligations of the Target CompanyMaterial ActionsCurrent Provisions:8.1\tThe Takeover Regulations currently provide that the target company shall not, during the offer period sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of assets of the company or its subsidiaries or enter into any material contracts.Committee Deliberations:8.2\tThe Committee desired to achieve a balance between the conflicting requirements of curbing a target company from carrying out material transaction without the consent of shareholders to make the company unattractive for an acquirer even while ensuring that the target companys freedom to carry out its day-to-day affairs is not curtailed.8.3\tIt was observed that as per extant provisions of the Takeover Regulations, it is mandated that the shareholders approval through postal ballot be obtained by the target company before entering into any material contract during the pendency of an open offer.Committee Recommendation:8.4\tThe Committee, therefore, recommends retaining restrictions on the target company during the offer period from carrying out material transactions outside the ordinary course of business except with the consent of the shareholders through a special resolution. The Committee recommends that such restrictions would also cover the subsidiaries of the target company, and such actions in respect of subsidiaries would also require approval of the shareholders of the target company.(See Regulation 26 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 49 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India9.0\tComposition of the BoardCurrent Provisions:9.1\tThe Takeover Regulations currently provide that till the offer formalities are completed, the target company shall be precluded from inducting any person or person nominated by the acquirer or belonging to his group into the board of the target company other than in cases, where acquirer deposits full consideration in an escrow account.Committee Deliberation:9.2\tThe Committee debated the right of an acquirer to appoint his representatives on the board of the target company. In this regard, the Committee observed that the extant Takeover Regulations specify that an acquirer may appoint his nominees on the Target Companys Board after 15 business days from the date of the detailed public statement by making cash deposit of 100 % of the consideration payable under the offer in the escrow account.9.3\tThe Committee recommends that ideally there ought to be no change in the board of directors of a target company during the pendency of the open offer, since the target company is in ^play^, and the fiduciary duty of directors towards all shareholders is at its greatest in such circumstances. However, there could be commercial circumstances that necessitate board representation for the acquirer. Therefore, in order to ensure that the obligations under the Takeover Regulations are in fact met, the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him may be represented on the board provided the entire consideration payable under the open offer is deposited in cash in the escrow account required under the Takeover Regulations, provided no competing offer has been made.9.4\tHowever, such appointment, even if cash is escrowed, ought not to be allowed for 15 business days from the date of the detailed public statement since during such period any other person may make a competing offer. In any event, the Committee has recommended that if a competing offer is made, there should be no appointments of directors representing any acquirer during the offer period. Similarly, where the acquirer has imposed a condition as to the minimum level of acceptances or other conditions precedent to the agreement triggering the offer remain unfulfilled, heReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 50 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiashould be restricted from appointing any new director representing him to the board of the target company during the offer period.9.5\tThe Committee observed that there ought to be no change to the board of a target company during the pendency of competing offers other than the vacation of office owing to death, incapacitation or resignation of a director. Any appointment of additional directors in such circumstances to fill the vacancy would not be permitted. The directors can be appointed only to fill vacancies arising out of death or incapacitation with the prior approval of the shareholders of the target company. Needless to add, an appointment of a director to the board of directors of the target company may take place only in compliance with the requirements specified thereof under the Companies Act, and the Takeover Regulations do not confer any special right to make such appointment  in fact, the Takeover Regulations only prescribe additional requirements and restrictions to be met for such appointment. Any appointment, therefore, would also have to be in compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act.Committee Recommendation:9.6\tThe Committee recommends that the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him may be represented on the board only after the expiry of a period of 15 business days from the date of the detailed public statement and provided the entire consideration payable under the open offer is deposited in cash in the escrow account required under the Takeover Regulations and the offer is not subject to any conditions other than regulatory approvals.9.7\tThe Committee also recommends that if a competing offer is made, there ought to be no appointments of directors during the offer period, and only casual vacancies arising out of death or incapacitation may be filled with prior approval of shareholders. (See Regulation 24 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)10.0 Timelines for the Open Offer processCurrent Provisions:10.1 The Committee discussed the current timelines for an open offer under the existingTakeover Regulations and reviewed the same with a view to shorten the timelines.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 51 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaCommittee Deliberations:10.2 Currently, the Takeover Regulations require a public announcement regarding the open offer to be made within four working days of acquiring or agreeing to acquire shares in the target company. The Committee is of the view that given the number of parties involved in the deal by that point of time, the time period was short, and yet, permitting a longer period of time to make a public announcement may lead to selective leakage of such price-sensitive news regarding the impending deal with the possibility of price distortions in respect of the scrip.10.3 Therefore, the Committee recommends that a short public announcement shall be made on the same day as the date of the transaction which triggered the open offer. A detailed public statement should be made within a period of five business days thereafter so as to accord the acquirer sufficient time to actually work out the logistics of the offer obligations.10.4 The Committee recommends that in order to ensure maximum and speedy dissemination of information to the public, copy of the public announcement should be submitted to the stock exchanges. Also, verification of information presented in the public announcement by a merchant banker registered with SEBI should be mandated so that only accurate information is given to the public. Thereafter, the detailed public statement should be published in the newspapers and should contain all essential information about the offer.10.5 The other activities in the offer process have been retained with an overall contraction in the timelines. The Committee is of the view that current timelines are mostly based on calendar days and there may be situations where due to holidays and weekends, it may be difficult to operate within the constraints of the regulatory timelines. The Committee deliberated and in line with global practices agreed to prescribe timelines in business days format in the best interest of all parties involved in the offer process.Committee Recommendation:10.6 The Committee recommends the following:a. A short public announcement should be made on the same date as the date oftransaction which triggered the open offer through a notice to the StockReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 52 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaExchange, followed by a detailed public statement within 5 business days of the public announcement.b. Post submission of draft letter of offer, all timelines are dependent on issue of comments by SEBI, thus the Committee recommends to link timelines (post submission of draft letter of offer) to the date of receipt of SEBI comments on the draft letter of offer.c. The letter of offer should be sent to the most recent set of shareholders. Therefore, the Committee recommends that date for reckoning the shareholders to whom the letter of offer shall be sent should be ten business days prior to commencement of the tendering period.d. Most shareholders tender their shares on the last few days of the offer period, after the date of final revision in price has been carried out, and hence the initial part of the offer period is virtually redundant. Hence, the overall time frame of the tendering period has been reduced to ten business days, and the last date for upward revision of offer price has been moved up to three business days prior to commencement of the tendering period.e.\tSince the last date of upward revision is prior to the opening of the open offer, shareholders are expected to be in receipt of all information to enable them to decide on the open offer. Therefore, there is no requirement to permit withdrawal of shares tendered in response to the open offer. This would also make the process more efficient.f. The acquirer shall issue an advertisement 1 business day prior to the opening of the tendering period announcing the schedule and procedure for tendering acceptances.g. The entire open offer process from the public announcement to the payment of consideration can now be done within fifty seven business days.h.

The Committee felt the need to permit and facilitate non-cash takeovers, where other securities can be used as a currency for M&A transactions. The Committee is also mindful of the fact that the objective of an open offer is to provide an exit to the shareholders and therefore adequate care should be taken to ensure that the shareholders are not stuck holding illiquid paper.11.3 In order to ensure that interests of the shareholders of the target company are duly protected, the Committee is of the view that only frequently traded equity shares that conform to specified criteria, secured and listed debt instruments with investment grade credit rating or above, and convertible instruments, which are converted into frequently traded shares, should be allowed as the modes of paying the offer price under the open offer.11.4 Further, in order to ensure that issuance of shares as consideration does not lead to undue delay in completion of offer formalities by the acquirer, the disclosures and other procedural requirements to be followed for such issue of shares are required to be appropriately spelt out. The Committee observed that such an issue being an issue to a select group of persons, viz. shareholders of the target company, would in the normal course get classified as preferential allotment, subject to the related requirements such as lock-in period, floor price computation, ineligibility due to saleReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 55 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiain the proximate past etc. In order to enable allotment of equity to tendering shareholders in an open offer, SEBI should amend the ICDR Regulations to facilitate a smooth issuance of equity shares in such cases in a clear and transparent manner.11.5 As regards pricing of such shares issued towards payment of offer price, the Committee felt that a clear and predictable price computation methodology should be provided to ascertain the number of shares to be given to a tendering shareholder in lieu of the shares tendered in acceptance of the open offer. The Committee recommends that the volume-weighted average price of such shares in the 60 trading days preceding the public announcement for the target company shall be the basis at which the acquirer can value the shares he is offering by way of the offer price.11.6 The Committee observed that SEBI has been making efforts to encourage issue of Indian Depository Receipts by foreign companies in India and to this effect, has laid down provisions in the ICDR Regulations. The Committee felt that permitting issuance of these instruments as a means of payment of consideration would on the one hand popularize this product and on the other would increase the options available to the acquirer to fulfill his financial obligations under the offer. The Committee suggests that SEBI may take up restrictions under exchange controls that impede the usage of these instruments in this regard.Committee Recommendation:The Committee recommends the following:(a) The offer price may be paid (i) in cash; (ii) by issue, exchange or transfer of frequently traded shares of the acquirer or of the persons acting in concert with the acquirer ; (iii) by issue, exchange or transfer of listed secured debt instruments issued by acquirer or the persons acting in concert with him with minimum rating of investment grade; (iv) by issue, exchange or transfer of convertible debt securities entitling the holder to acquire listed shares of the acquirer or of the person acting in concert with him; or (v) a combination of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv)(b) In cases where the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him, proposes to pay the offer consideration by way of issue of its listed shares, the acquirer or PAC as the case may be, may take its shareholder approval for the purpose of allotment of shares up to a specified percentage of the equity capital of the issuer and any allotment of shares pursuant to such resolution may be made within a period of one year from the date of passing of the resolution or till the date next AGM, whichever is earlier.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 56 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India(c) ICDR Regulations may be appropriately amended to facilitate such open offers.(d) Where the acquirer has acquired more than 10 % of the voting rights in the target company in cash during the fifty two weeks prior to the public announcement, the shareholders of the target company should be provided an option to receive the payment of offer consideration in cash.(e) The Committee also recommends due certification from an independent merchant banker or by a chartered accountant with a minimum of 10 years standing on valuation of shares of the issuer and the basis for arriving at the relevant exchange ratio.(See Regulation 9 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)12.0 Exemptions from open offer obligationsCurrent Provisions:12.1 The Takeover Regulations currently provide for fourteen categories of transactions which are exempted from the requirement to make an open offer subject to satisfying the conditions specified therein, if any, without the need to seek SEBIs approval for the same. Further, for the transactions that are not covered in the aforesaid fourteen categories, an application can be made for seeking exemption from SEBI. Such applications are referred to a takeover panel for its recommendations. SEBI considers the recommendations received and passes an appropriate order.Committee Deliberations:12.2 The Committee discussed each of the aforesaid fourteen categories as to its relevance for exemptions without seeking SEBIs approval. It was noted that open offer obligations can arise either on account of acquisition of shares or voting rights beyond the thresholds specified for initial trigger or creeping acquisition trigger or a change in control. The Committee was of the view that the regulatory obligations from which an acquisition should be exempted without seeking SEBIs approval (referred as ^such exemptions^ hereinafter) should depend on the nature of the acquisition as well as its significance. The Committee felt that such exemptions in general should be minimal and the exemption conditions should be clearly and unambiguously spelt out so that acquirers in particular do not face any uncertainties in this respect. Consequently, a number of such exemptions, which have not been used very frequently, have beenReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 57 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaeliminated; e.g. allotment of shares pursuant to an application made under a Public Issue, acquisition of shares in the ordinary course of business by a market maker, acquisition of shares in the ordinary course of business by Public Financial Institutions on their own account, etc.Committee Recommendation:12.3 The Committee has classified the exemptions on the basis of the specific charging provisions which deal with the obligation to make an open offer, and has sought to distinguish between acquisitions involving change in control and those involving only consolidation of shareholding. The deliberations in brief and the recommendations of the Committee on the same are discussed below under separate heads.Exemption from open offer obligations in case of acquisition of shares and / or control12.4 Acquisitions arising out of inter-se transfer of shares among ^qualifying parties\" as specified under the Regulations would be exempt from making an open offer. The nature and type of such qualifying parties has been spelt out with the underlying principle being that such transfers do not represent a typical acquisition carrying an economic value, which ought to result in providing an exit opportunity to all shareholders. The only circumstance where this principle has been deviated from is to permit transfer between co-promoters, or persons acting in concert, who have been disclosed as such for at least three years, and that too only if the premium being paid to the exiting party is less than 25 % of the volume weighted average price over the 12 weeks period and subject to the parties having complied with all their disclosure obligations.12.5 The Committee felt that acquisition of shares in the ordinary course of business by stock brokers, under-writers, merchant bankers, and specific persons performing specific routine commercial roles should be out of the purview of an open offer obligation.12.6 In respect of inter-se transfers amongst certain ^qualifying parties\" as listed and defined under the Takeover Regulations, the Committee recommends that, in order to curb the abuse of introduction of new entities as qualifying parties, in most cases a requirement of pre-existing relationship of at least three years has been prescribed. In particular, the current exemption on Group Companies which does not have this threeReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 58 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiayear requirement has been restricted to transfers between co-subsidiaries and their parents where there is no change in control.12.7 In respect of schemes of re-arrangement approved by a court or other competent authority, the Committee felt that where the schemes entail a transformation of the target company, it would be desirable to continue to provide for an exemption from the obligation to make an open offer. However, if the schemes do not really involve or deal with the target company per se, and an acquisition of shares or voting rights in, or control over the target company were to take place beyond the thresholds specified for the open offer obligations, as a consequence of the main scheme, the treatment should be different. The Committee considered the possibility of removing the exemptions from all Schemes of Arrangement or Mergers / Demergers where the target company was not a party. However, the Committee concluded that such an elimination of the exemption may not be equitable in the case of transactions that are genuine mergers (which several other laws including the Income Tax Act also recognize as deserving special treatment). After deliberations, the Committee arrived at the consensus that in cases of reorganization not involving the target company, where 25 % or more of the consideration under the scheme were offered by way of cash or cash equivalents (and hence the transaction was not just a merger) or where the existing body of shareholders of the parent retain less than 33 % of the combined entity, the shareholders of the target company ought to get an exit opportunity too.12.8 The Committee also thought it fit to clarify that voting rights that accrue on preference shares in proportion to the paid up preference share capital, when dividend remains unpaid beyond the periods set out in Section 87(2) of the Companies Act, 1956, would not attract an obligation to make an open offer. Such voting rights are temporary in nature and upon dividend being paid, cease to exist. Moreover, even the voting rights on equity shares would vary when voting rights accrue on the preference shares and abate when dividend is paid.Exemption from open offer obligations in case of acquisition of shares only and not control12.9 Corporate Debt Restructuring under the scheme prescribed by the RBI provides a means by which funds can be infused into a financially weak company. Presently there is no specific provision under the Takeover Regulations that explicitly exemptsReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 59 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiasuch schemes. Consequently, the Board receives a number of applications seeking exemptions.12.10 The Committee recommends that acquisitions pursuant to such schemes may be exempted from triggering the open offer obligation under the Takeover Regulations only if the scheme has been authorized by the shareholders by way of a special resolution passed by postal ballot, and no change in control over the target company takes place through such acquisition.Exemption from open offer obligations in case of acquisition of substantial stake12.11 The Committee observed that companies routinely avail of loans from the banks and financial institutions for their working capital requirements and other funding needs. Often, such acquisitions involve the pledging of shares of a target company, and these pledges do get invoked in the event of loan default or otherwise. Normally the shares so pledged with an individual bank would be well within the enhanced threshold specified under Regulation 3(1). In view of this, the Committee considered it appropriate to exempt acquisition of shares by a consortium of banks pursuant to invocation of a pledge.12.12 The Committee was cognizant of the fact that share buy-backs may be undertaken by a company as a way of returning value to the shareholders. The Committee feels that such passive increase in shareholding resulting in a stake exceeding the trigger in Regulation 3(1) is possible, but given that that this trigger is to be considered sacrosanct, the Committee believes that no one should be entitled to retain a stake above such threshold. Therefore, the Committee recommends that such shareholders be given ninety days to reduce their stake to a level below the threshold set out in Regulation 3(1).Exemption from open offer obligations in case of acquisition of shares beyond the creeping threshold12.13 The Committee believes that certain acquisitions may be exempted from making an open offer under Regulation 3(2) considering the level of creeping acquisition permitted. However, the same type of acquisition ought not to be exempted under Regulation 3(1), where the threshold of the trigger is enhanced and is sacrosanct.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 60 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaSpecial Exemptions12.14 The Committee was also mindful that SEBI currently has the powers to grant exemption from the obligation to make an open offer and recommends retention of the same. It would be open to SEBI to seek advice of an expert Panel before granting an exemption from an open offer obligation.12.15 The Committee has recommended that the Board may also grant an exemption or relaxation from strict compliance from specific requirements only under special circumstances. Any exemption or relaxation may be made only in exceptional cases and that too in the broader interests of the investors in securities and the securities markets. In all such cases, an order with justification should be published by SEBI.Whitewash Provisions12.16 The Takeover Regulations currently provide for whitewash in case of change in control of the target company i.e. an open offer would not be required if the shareholders of the target company were to pass a special resolution waiving the open offer in case of change in control.12.17 The Committee observed that providing for whitewash only for change in control and not for substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights (without change in control) apparently is an unintended anomaly. The Committee examined the possibility of introducing a whitewash provision in the Takeover Regulations on the lines of international practice i.e. an open offer would not be required if a material majority of the shareholders of the target company were to pass a resolution waiving the open offer. The rationale for such a framework is that an open offer is ultimately made for the benefit of the shareholders and it is well within the shareholders rights to renounce such a benefit if they so desire.12.18 Whitewash provisions may be required in situations where (i) the transaction is triggered by an asset or share acquisition by the target company, where consideration was paid by issuing shares of the target company; (ii) the transaction is a preferential allotment or other primary infusion which breaches the relevant thresholds; (iii) the transaction is a bail-out takeover; (iv) acquirers acquisition of voting rights is due to receipt of shares/ voting rights as gift; or (v) acquisition is made in an environment where the liquidity is scarce. In such circumstances, it is possible that a transaction that a majority of shareholders desire and support may be rendered infeasible due to the need to make an open offer. In such cases, whitewash provisions may provide theReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 61 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaacquirer an opportunity to take control of the target company or to cross the relevant substantial acquisition or creeping acquisition limits, with the approval of shareholders of the target company who repose their faith and confidence in the acquirer.12.19 The Committee considered imposing strict conditions such as a high positive waiver vote requirement (say, 90 %) and a minimum voter participation threshold. Some members felt that the absence of such a framework would make the Takeover Regulations onerous with no room to exempt from an open offer even where the shareholders themselves do not desire it. It was however observed that in the absence of robust regulations on proxy solicitation, and given the realities of the Indian market, any provision for shareholder waiver for an open offer may not be in the best interests of investors at large. Moreover, some members of the Committee felt strongly against a majority of the shareholders exercising the power to waive an open offer imposing their will on an out-voted minority.12.20 The Committee observed that SEBI is taking certain steps to promote institutional voting, and that it is also pursuing means to operationalise electronic-voting. It was therefore felt that the market is not yet ready for a whitewash mechanism for automatic exemptions from open offers. In any case, as observed, the shareholders always have option not to tender their shares if they so desire. While SEBI does have discretionary powers to grant exemptions from open offers, it would be open to SEBI to take into account whether a significant majority has waived the right to an open offer, when considering an application for exemption.12.21 The Committee is of the view that although whitewash provisions are, in principle, not undesirable, the time is not yet ripe to introduce the same in India. Therefore, the current whitewash provision in case of change in control of the target company has not been retained.(See Regulations 10 & 11 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)13.0 Recommendation by the independent directors of the Target CompanyCurrent Provisions:13.1 The Takeover Regulations currently provide that the board of directors of the targetcompany may, if they so desire, send their unbiased comments and recommendationsReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 62 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaon the offer(s) to the shareholders, keeping in mind the fiduciary responsibility of the directors to the shareholders.Committee Deliberations:13.2 Most jurisdictions the world over including U.K, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong mandate that the board of directors of the target company issues its considered recommendation on the open offer to the targets shareholders. The Takeover Regulations entirely leave it to the discretion of directors of the target company to issue their recommendations, if any, on an open offer. It has been noticed that this provision has seldom been used.13.3 The Committee feels that the board of directors of the target company ought not to play a passive role but take a more conscious position when an open offer is made for its shares,. The boards of directors and in particular, the independent directors have a fiduciary responsibility towards the shareholders.13.4 The Committee feels that in order to achieve the regulatory objective and also to further the objectives of good corporate governance, the independent directors ought to give their recommendation on the open offer to the shareholders.Committee Recommendation:13.5 The Committee recommends that the independent directors on the board of directors of the target company ought to make a reasoned recommendation on the open offer. For the making of such a recommendation, the board of the target company ought to appoint a committee of independent directors with freedom to consult and engage external advisors such as merchant bankers, chartered accountants and lawyers at the expense of the target company. Such committee of independent directors ought to make a reasoned recommendation and such recommendation ought to be sent to all the stock exchanges where the shares of the target company are listed and be published in the same newspapers where the relevant detailed public statement of the open offer was published.(See Regulation 26 (6) of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 63 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India14.0 Obligations of the AcquirerDisposal of assets of the Target CompanyCurrent Provisions:14.1 The Takeover Regulations currently provide that where the acquirer has not stated his intention to dispose of or otherwise encumber any assets of the target company except in the ordinary course of business of the target company, the acquirer shall be debarred from disposing of or otherwise encumbering the assets of the target company for a period of 2 years from the date of closure of the public offer.Committee Deliberations:14.2 The Committee believes that the acquirer needs to give as clear a picture as possible about his strategic intent and future plans with the target company upon making the acquisition. The very fact that the acquirer has acquired or agreed to acquire a stake large enough to trigger an open offer would indicate that the acquirer would be reasonably expected to have a view on the future strategies of the target company. While the Committee believes that disclosures about such future plans ought to be improved to make the letter of offer more relevant. There is also a need to minimize reproduction of known information about the target company, particularly since the target company is a listed company with full exposure in the public domain. On the specific issue of disposal of assets outside the ordinary course after taking over control over the target company, there is a need for the acquirer to clearly state his intentions upfront.14.3 The Committee also observed that such intentions should be stated upfront not only for the target company but also for its subsidiaries. However, the Committee recognized that there could be circumstances which may change occasioning the need for restructuring and / or disposal of assets of the target company after the acquisition has been completed. Hence the committee has proposed suitable provisions in this regard as well.14.4 If no intention to dispose of assets of the target company once in control over the target company (including its subsidiaries) has been expressed upfront, the acquirer ought to be precluded from causing the target company to dispose of the assets for a period of two years after the offer period unless shareholders authorize such disposalReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 64 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaby way of a special resolution passed by postal ballot. It is likely that an acquirer indeed had no intention of causing a disposal of assets by the target company at the time of making a public announcement but subsequently new developments necessitate such a disposal. Also, once in control, an acquirer may decide to take such action following a detailed review of the target company. For taking such action, the target company would have to take shareholders into confidence and get a special resolution passed, with the explanatory statement for the resolution setting out reasons for why such disposal is necessary.Committee Recommendation:14.5 The Committee recommends that unless acquirer has declared an intention in the detailed public statement and the letter of offer, the acquirer shall be debarred from alienating any material assets of the target company (including its subsidiaries) for a period of two years after the offer period. However, where such alienation is necessary despite no such intention having been expressed by the acquirer, the target company shall require a special resolution passed by the shareholders by way of a postal ballot.(See Regulation 25 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)15.0 Obligations of the Merchant BankerCurrent Provisions:15.1 The Takeover Regulations currently provide that the merchant banker shall ensure compliance of the Takeover Regulations and any other laws or rules as may be applicable in this regard and provide other specific obligations under Regulations 24 of the current Takeover Regulations.Committee Deliberations:15.2 The role of a merchant banker is central to the effective operation of the Takeover Regulations. The merchant banker is expected to play an objective professional role in advising the acquirer of all his obligations under the Takeover Regulations and in ensuring that the compliance requirements prescribed under the regulations are effectively met in the process of the open offer. The Committee believes that against the backdrop of this principle, it is important to ensure that there is complete clarityReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 65 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiafor the merchant banker in respect of his own role as well as the responsibility of the clients to enable him to comply with the regulatory requirements.Committee Recommendation:15.3 The Committee recommends that the merchant banker would be expected to demonstrate the application of due skill, care and diligence in the discharge of professional duties cast on him and the obligations of the merchant banker ought to be construed accordingly. It is perhaps likely that despite following best practices and full application of diligence, skill and care, an acquirer could end up defaulting under the Takeover Regulations. In such circumstances, the Committee believes that, in the least, the expectation from a merchant banker would be a demonstration of the bona fide efforts undertaken by him in professionally and diligently discharging the role envisaged for the merchant banker under the regulations.(See Regulation 27 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)16.0 Disclosure ObligationsCurrent Provisions:16.1 The current Takeover Regulations obligate any acquirer who crosses the specified thresholds to disclose at every stage his aggregate shareholding or voting right to the company concerned and to the stock exchanges where shares of the company are listed. It also obligates a promoter / majority shareholder to annually disclose to the company and the concerned stock exchange regarding the number and percentage of shares or voting rights held by him along with PACs.Committee Deliberations:16.2 The disclosure obligations under the Takeover Regulations are fairly critical and an important component of the legal regime governing substantial acquisition of shares and takeovers. The Committee noted that disclosure requirements specified in Regulations 6, 7 and 8 of the Takeover Regulations have served well since inception. Certain aspects, such as whether disclosures should be by individual shareholders or collectively by all persons acting in concert, have been addressed in the proposed regulations.Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 66 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of India16.3 The intent behind the disclosure regime is not only to ensure that the target company is not taken by surprise but also to ensure that price discovery in the market for shares of the target company takes place in an informed manner, where the very fact of an interested acquirer increasing his holding would contribute to the emergence of price at which sellers would be willing to sell their shares in the market. Also, such price discovery has implications for the computation of the minimum offer price in the look-back period. While it is very clear what percentage of the equity shares of a company are held by parties exceeding the thresholds, it is not clear what that partys effective economic interest in the company actually is, since it includes instruments which while presently not entitling the holder to voting rights, may, in the future, lead to accrual of shares/voting rights.16.4 The Committee noted that although at present, the derivative Futures and Options (F&O) segment is cash settled, the Board has taken a decision to permit delivery based acquisitions in this segment in the near future. Such acquisitions shall have a far-reaching effect on multiple regulations and their implications would have to be examined by the Board at the appropriate time. For example, in such event, there would be a need to review not only whether one would need to prescribe disclosures about such economic interests in securities of a target company, but also how such derivatives would influence the minimum offer price, if executed within the look-back period.16.5 The Committee believes that the Board ought to set up an electronic platform, or alternatively mandate every nationwide stock exchange to provide a platform on their websites, to which merchant bankers and compliance offers of listed companies are to be given password-protected access rights to upload information required to be disclosed under the Takeover Regulations  be it disclosure obligations required from the target company or those required of acquirers. This would enable dissemination of the information on a real-time basis as and when the relevant parties comply with the various requirements under the Takeover Regulations.Committee Recommendation:16.6 The Committee recommends that the acquirer promoter / shareholders shall be asked to disclose their acquisition on periodic as well as transaction specific basis upon crossing the limits specified therein to the Stock Exchange. Further, such disclosures shall be of the aggregated shareholding and voting rights of the acquirer and everyReport of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19, 2010 Page 67 of 138Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaperson acting in concert with him. Moreover, the acquisition and holding of any security or instrument that would entitle the acquirer to receive shares in the target company, including warrants and convertible debentures, shall also be required to be disclosed.(See Regulation 28 of the Proposed Takeover Regulations)17.0 Present Tax regime17.1 The Committee discussed about the tax treatment provided to the shareholders in an open offer vis--vis a transaction through the stock exchanges. It was noted that the present tax regime in India is more favorable towards the open market transactions as against open offer transactions. For taxation purposes, an open offer transaction is considered akin to an off-market deal, which in the view of the Committee is not desirable.17.2 Off-market deals, by their very nature, are entered into between private individuals in a non-transparent and largely unregulated manner. On the other hand, open offer, as an activity, is highly regulated and all the parties involved in the process are required to follow the provisions laid down in the Takeover Regulations, including various disclosures requirements. Also, the basic objective of an open offer is to benefit investors at large by granting them a just and fair exit opportunity. It would perhaps not be correct to club a regulated and investor friendly activity like open offers in the same bracket as an off-market deal.17.3 Therefore, the Committee is of the view that there is a need to bring parity in the tax treatment given to the shareholders who tender their shares in an open offer and those who are selling the same in the open market. The Committee recommends that SEBI may like to suitably take up this issue with the concerned authorities in the Government.******Report of the Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee dated July 19,

      "Discussion Paper on Exit Offer toDissenting ShareholdersBackground1. Section 13 and Section 27 of Companies Act, 2013 have prescribed that dissenting shareholders shall be given an exit opportunity by promoters and shareholders having control over the company in accordance with the regulations to be specified by SEBI. Both these sections have come into force w.e.f. April 01, 2014.2. The relevant extract of Act is reproduced below for ease of reference: Section 13(8) of Companies Act, 2013:Alteration of memorandum\"A company, which has raised money from public through prospectus and still has any unutilised amount out of the money so raised, shall not change its objects for which it raised the money through prospectus unless a special resolution is passed by the company anda. the details, as may be prescribed, in respect of such resolution shall also be published in the newspapers (one in English and one in vernacular language) which is in circulation at the place where the registered office of the company is situated and shall also be placed on the website of the company, if any, indicating therein the justification for such change;b. the dissenting shareholders shall be given an opportunity to exit by the promoters and shareholders having control in accordance with regulations to be specified by the Securities and Exchange Board.\"Section 27 of Companies Act, 2013:Variation in terms of contract or objects in prospectus.(1) A company shall not, at any time, vary the terms of a contract referred to in the prospectus or objects for which the prospectus was issued, except subject to the approval of, or except subject to an authority given by the company in general meeting by way of special resolution:Exit to Dissenting shareholders\tPage 1Provided that the details, as may be prescribed, of the notice in respect of such resolution to shareholders, shall also be published in the newspapers (one in English and one in vernacular language) in the city where the registered office of the company is situated indicating clearly the justification for such variation:Provided further that such company shall not use any amount raised by it through prospectus for buying, trading or otherwise dealing in equity shares of any other listed company.(2) The dissenting shareholders being those shareholders who have not agreed to the proposal to vary the terms of contracts or objects referred to in the prospectus, shall be given an exit offer by promoters or controlling shareholders at such exit price, and in such manner and conditions as may be specified by the Securities and Exchange Board by making regulations in this behalf.\"3. Accordingly, SEBI is in the process of framing regulations under the aforesaid provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. In this regard, public comments are being sought on the following related issues:ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION1) APPLICABILITY OF THE PROVISION:The provisions may be made applicable on a prospective basis since the provisions of the Act have been made applicable on a prospective basis. This would also take care of the apprehension of the inability of the promoters to bring in additional cash in a short span of time.Also, the provision should be made applicable to such contracts which may substantially affect the main line of business or revenue generation of the company.It has been suggested that the requirement of providing exit to dissenting shareholders may affect fresh capital raising as well as capital availability. Thus, the regulations may provide that if an offer is dissented by a specified percentage, say 10% of shareholders, the company may provide exit offer. This will require suitable changes in Companies Act as well.2) ELIGIBILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS FOR AVAILING THE EXIT OFFERExit to Dissenting shareholders\tPage 2It is presumed that investors in the secondary market take an informed decision of investing in the equity shares of the company after doing a full background check on the same. This includes the objects of the company for which the company has raised money from the market. Thus, investors who invested in the company through secondary market should also be given a fair opportunity of exiting the company in case they do not agree to the change in objects of the company.Therefore investors who are holding shares as on the date on which the proposal to change the objects becomes public should be allowed to exit under this provision.3) OFFER PRICE FOR THE EXIT OFFERReliance on a historical price distorts the value of the shares and such a price may not be reflective of the prevailing market price. Further, a higher exit price than the prevailing market price may significantly influence the decision making of the investor in favour of achieving short term gains vis--vis evaluating exit in the context of long term potential of the company. Thus, the exit price should be based on the existing market value of the stock. The exit price may be based on price determined in case of exit offer given to the existing shareholders in terms of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers), Regulations, 2011 which, in cases of frequently traded shares, is the highest of the following:(i)\tVolume weighted average price paid during fifty two weeks immediately preceding the date of the announcement.(ii)\tHighest price paid for any acquisition during the twenty six weeks immediately preceding the date of the announcement.(iii) Volume weighted average market price for a period of sixty trading days immediately preceding the date of the announcement.4) CARVE OUTS FOR COMPANIES WITH NO IDENTIFIABLE PROMOTERS OR SHAREHOLDERS HAVING CONTROLSince the exit offer has to be given by promoters or shareholders having control, whether companies with no identifiable promoters or shareholders having control can be exempted from this requirement. This will require suitable changes in Companies Act as well.Exit to Dissenting shareholders\tPage 35) EXIT OFFER IN CASES WHERE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF AMOUNT RAISED FOR THE ISSUE HAS ALREADY BEEN UTILIZEDThere may be instances wherein a company has already utilized higher percentage of the amount raised and intends to change the objects to some extent due to certain reasons. In such cases, the promoters or persons in control should give exit opportunity only if the amount utilized is less than a specified percentage of the total amount raised for the objects of the issue, e.g. 75%. This will require suitable changes in Companies Act as well.6) EXEMPTION FROM MANDATORY TRIGGER OF OPEN OFFER REQUIREMENTSThere may be instances wherein the promoters or shareholders in control may trigger open offer obligations owing to shareholding increasing beyond 25% or through creeping acquisition. Such increase in shareholding due to mandatory requirement of law should be exempted from open offer obligations. Further regulation 3(2) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers), Regulations, 2011 does not allow any person to acquire the shares voluntarily in case the shareholding pursuant to the acquisition exceeds maximum permissible public shareholding. In cases where promoters are already holding 75%, they should be allowed to acquire further shares.In the event shares accepted in the offer are such that the aggregate shareholding of the promoter exceeds 75% of the total paid up capital of the company, the promoter shall comply with the stipulation mentioned under rule 19A read with rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 i.e. bring their shareholding to 75% in one year.7) MANNER OF PROVIDING EXIT OPPORTUNITY TO DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERSa) The notice proposing the passing of the special resolution for changing the objects of the issue and variation in terms of contact or objects in prospectus shall also contain information about the exit offer to the dissenting shareholders.b) In addition to the disclosures required under section 102 of the Act read with rule 32 of Companies (Incorporation) Rules, 2014 and rule 7 of Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 and or any other applicable law, aExit to Dissenting shareholders\tPage 4statement to the effect that the promoters or controlling shareholders shall provide an exit opportunity to the dissenting shareholders shall also be disclosed in the explanatory statement to the notice for passing special resolution. The regulatory requirements in this regard is placed as Annexure to this Discussion Paper.c) After passing of the special resolution, voting results as specified in regulation 44(3) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and disclosure requirements) regulations, 2015 including the list of dissenting shareholders would be communicated to the Stock Exchanges.d) The issuer shall also intimate the Stock Exchanges on which the securities of the company are listed about the offer of promoters or shareholders having control to dissenting shareholders and the price at which the exit offer is being given. The Stock Exchanges shall immediately on receipt of such intimation disseminate the same to public within one working day.e) The promoters or shareholders in control shall appoint a Merchant Banker registered with SEBI and finalise the exit price in accordance with the regulations specified in this regard.f) To ensure security for performance of their obligations, promoters or shareholders having control shall create an escrow account and deposit the aggregate consideration in the account at least two working days prior to opening of the tendering period.g) The tendering period shall start not later than seven working days from the passing of the special resolution and shall remain open for ten working days.h) The promoters or shareholders having control shall facilitate tendering of shares by the shareholders and settlement of the same through the Stock exchange mechanism as specified by SEBI vide Circular No. CIR/CFD/ POLICYCELL/1/2015 dated April 13, 2015i) The promoters or shareholders having control shall, within a period of ten working days from the last date of the tendering period, make payment of consideration to the shareholders who have accepted the exit offer.Exit to Dissenting shareholders\tPage 5j) Within a period of two working days from the payment of consideration, the listed company shall make a disclosure to the Stock Exchange giving details of aggregate number of shares tendered, accepted, payment of consideration and the post offer shareholding pattern of the promoters and a report by the merchant banker that the payment has been duly made to all the shareholders who offered their shares to exit from the company after dissenting to the proposal.Public comments:4.

A Consultative Sub-Committee also extensively consulted and discussed various issues with all the major stakeholders, particularly infrastructure institutions, investors and industry associations.The Committee would like to convey its deep appreciation for the professional and organizational help extended by officials of SEBI, SEBI's member Dr. K.M. Abraham, and Mr. J.N.

The other members of the Committee were:a. Dr. K.P. Krishnan, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance Secretary (till June 30, 2010), Secretary, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India (from July 1, 2010)b. Shri. Kishor Chaukar, Managing Director, Tata Industriesc. Shri. Uday Kotak, Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltdd. Prof. G. Sethu, Officer on Special Duty, National Institute of Securities Marketse. Dr. K. M. Abraham, Whole Time Member, SEBIf. Shri J.N. Gupta, Executive Director, SEBI (Member Secretary).Under the terms of reference, the Committee needed to review and make recommendations on the following issues:a. Ownership structure of stock exchanges and clearing corporationsb. Board composition of stock exchanges and clearing corporationsc. Listing and governance of stock exchanges and clearing corporationsd. Balance between regulatory and business functions of stock exchanges and clearing corporations, with reference to their for profit statuse. Relationship between stock exchanges and clearing corporationsf. Relationship between stock exchanges and technology providers, andg. Competition policy for stock exchanges and clearing corporations3Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaSince Depositories form an important part of securities market infrastructure, subsequently, Depositories were included under the scope of the Committee.MethodologyThe committee examined the overall evolution of Indian markets over the years and noted that Indian markets have progressed and responded to its specific needs and socioeconomic demands; in addition, there has been a commensurate development in the regulatory framework in line with this evolution. The committee noted that each market has its unique characteristics and Indian markets are no exception and they too have undergone significant changes over the years. This process has also encompassed changes inter-alia in ownership and governance norms of the MIIs. However, the committee recognised that participation and contribution from all stakeholders has almost invariably preceded any successful change.Therefore, the Committee decided to adopt a consultative approach to have the benefit of views of all the stakeholders, viz. market infrastructure institutions (MII), market participants, shareholders of MIIs, industry associations, investors and general public, on the relevant issues. Accordingly, a consultative subcommittee was formed which sought comments of stakeholders by sending them a questionnaire (Annexure  A to this report). This questionnaire was also placed on SEBIs website.Subsequently, this sub-committee also held discussions with representatives of NSE, BSE, MCX-SX, NSDL, CDSL, ANMI, BSE Broker Forum, DPAI, LIC, UBS, Deloitte, Financial Technologies and others. The consolidated views of the MIIs and various stakeholders were placed for deliberation before the Committee. The responses received have been tabulated and placed at Annexure  B to this report.4Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaIn addition, the Committee also examined the global experience concerning ownership and governance norms of MIIs. Several papers published by World Bank, IOSCO and other such institutions were studied.This report brings out the recommendations of the Committee. The committee while framing its recommendations, has taken into account the views expressed by different stakeholders, MIIs as well as the Indian experience and global experience concerning the working of the MIIs.The committee recommends that the report may be placed on SEBIs website for public comments and take the comments received into account before implementing the recommendations.5Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaChapter I Introduction1.1. STABILITY VERSUS GROWTH  THE PERENNIAL DEBATEThe financial crisis over the last three years impacted world economies in varying degrees and forced them to act in different ways to meet the challenges that emerged. Since then, almost all world economies in some manner, have subjected their historically settled views on financial stability to a rigorous reexamination. In the process, many of them have critically revisited the role of important financial institutions and the risks arising to the economy from the operations of such institutions. Consequently, public policy on important financial institutions has refocused around the realization that:a. There are financial institutions and markets, which have systemic impact across their local economies and often beyond that.b. If the failure or malfunction of such institutions is not contained, it can engender widespread distress, either through its direct impact or as a trigger for broader contagion.c. Such contagion will impact the financial system primarily, however, it can have significant impact on the real economy as well.The Committee has taken into account these lessons learnt since the financial crisis and recognises that in the evolutionary process characterizing a growing market, changes are inevitable; however, these changes should not cause instability. Broadly, the point of view adopted by the Committee is that, any change in the financial regulatory approach to a structure or functioning of institutions such as stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories should be introduced in a calibrated manner. At the same time, the Committee recognises that conditions conducive to innovation in these institutions are6Securities and Exchange Board of Indianecessary for the growth of an economy like India. Therefore, the governance and ownership norms for such institutions need to be tailored carefully so that on the one hand, it ensures safety and reliability of markets, and on the other, MIIs retain their ability to innovate on the products, processes and the range of services they offer.1.2. MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE INSTITUTIONSStock exchanges, depositories and clearing corporations are collectively referred to as securities Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs). Literally, the term infrastructure would mean the basic, underlying framework or features of a system; and the term market infrastructure denotes such fundamental facilities and systems serving this market. The primary purpose of securities /capital market is to enable allocation/reallocation of capital/financial resources. This movement helps optimal use of money in the economy and fosters economic development. Well-functioning MIIs have a net positive effect on society like any other infrastructure institutions.The committee posed a question to itself whether these institutions can be called Market Infrastructure Institutions. Broadly, there are no set parameters drawn up to define an infrastructure institution and the same holds true for infrastructure institutions in the context of the securities markets. However, the research on attributes of infrastructure institutions yields distinct considerations that set apart an infrastructure institution from others.The key attributes of an infrastructure institution1 are listed below. These attributes are not mutually exclusive. Often, there can be a significant degree of overlap between the attributes.7Securities and Exchange Board of India1. Essential facility doctrine: A commonly accepted attribute of infrastructure institutions is that the goods or services they produce are essential in some manner. A legal doctrine has been evolved under US anti-trust law called the essential facility doctrine. The key thrust of this doctrine is that a monopolistic operator of an essential facility may be obliged to provide access to a competitor.Under the Indian Competition Act, 20022, it has been recognised that any application of the essential facilities doctrine should satisfy the following:^\tThe facility must be controlled by a dominant firm in the relevant market^\tCompeting enterprises/persons should lack a realistic ability to reproduce the facility^\tAccess to the facility is necessary in order to compete in the relevant market; and^\tIt must be feasible to provide access to the facility.2. Networks: Externalities, Switching Costs and Standards: An infrastructure institution is often thought to be or to provide a network. Four key characteristics of network industries have been identified3 which distinguish them from other types of markets:^\tconsumption externalities^\tswitching costs and lock-in^\tcomplementarity, compatibility and standards and^\tsignificant economies of scale in productionInfrastructure institutions may enjoy market power because of different network effects. The dependence of customer demand on the choices of8Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaother customers is known as participation, consumption or sometimes a network externality. A positive consumption externality is an advantage that an incumbent firm has over potential competitors for providing a network and is a benefit that accrues to the users of such a network, which is dependent on the condition that other participants are already using the same network.As seen from the related literature4, switching costs and product standards can also affect the economies of networks. Switching costs affect price competition in two opposing ways. First, if consumers are already locked into using a specific product, firms may raise prices knowing that consumers will not switch unless the price difference exceeds the switching cost to a competing brand. Second, if consumers are not locked in, brand-producing firms will compete intensively by offering discounts and complimentary products and services in order to attract consumers who later on will be locked in the technology.3. Economies of Scale: Infrastructure institutions often exhibit economies of scale. These occur when the average cost of producing a good or service decline with the number of units produced. A common reason for the existence of economies of scale is the presence of fixed costs of production or marketing.In theory, the presence of high fixed costs of production may make it impossible for any new entrant to cater to a market and cover its long-run average costs while providing competition to existing players. Other effects are more common with high fixed costs of production. One is a scale monopoly, in which a single incumbent firm is able to cover its costs and is not threatened by new entry because the market is too small to9Securities and Exchange Board of Indiasupport two firms. Another is a concentrated or oligopolistic market, where the market is able to support two or three firms.If competition is effective, however, it may drive average pricing below the long run average costs, leading to one or more firms exiting the market. The eventual outcome may thus be competitively inefficient, as the continuing exit of firms may result in a monopoly. Even though it may appear that, while industries with high fixed costs and low variable costs may be competitively efficient, even if there are only two or three competing firms, the most likely outcome would still be competitive inefficiency.4. Sunk Costs: Infrastructure institutions are often characterized by the presence of sunk costs. Such costs are expenses, which a firm needs to incur to enter a market, but cannot recover if it leaves the market. Sunk costs are barriers to exit and prevent hit and run entrants who exploit any inefficiency present, and then leave the market when such inefficiency has been exploited.5. Natural Monopoly: Infrastructure institutions are frequently referred to as being, or operating, natural monopolies. This term has historically been used to describe situations where it was believed that only one firm was able to operate in a specific market, with the implication that any such firm should be subject to special regulatory arrangements. The most common reason for the perceived existence of a natural monopoly was that it was uneconomic to replicate expensive infrastructure, given the presence of economies of scale.10Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaThe word natural in the phrase natural monopoly is misleading, as it implies that a particular structure of the relevant industry is natural and inevitable. This has frequently been shown to be not true. Economies of scale need not give rise to monopolies inevitably. A competitor may be able to enter the relevant market and force the incumbent firm to exit; the threat of potential entry too can impose a significant competitive discipline. Technological developments also have allowed competition to threaten many monopolies previously considered natural.Stock exchanges and clearing corporations are subject to significant network externalities. In case of stock exchanges, liquidity begets liquidity is a well-known fact. The probability of an order being executed is higher in a liquid stock exchange. Moreover, the bid-ask spread will be lesser which will result in a lesser impact cost for a transaction executed on a liquid stock exchange. Similarly, the benefits of netting will result in lesser margins and collateral requirements for clearing members transacting through larger clearing corporations. Other factors that increase market power for MIIs are economies of scale and law/regulation that deny access to new entities, switching costs, etc.The observations above also seem to suggest that a single trading system, clearing corporation and depository is likely to gain and keep market power in the provision of services in any one market.1.3. MIIs AS SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONSMIIs are systemically important institutions in any economy. In India, this can be observed from the phenomenal growth of these institutions in terms of market capitalization of listed companies, amount of capital raised and number of investor accounts with brokers and depositories and value of assets held in the depositories account. Market capitalization of listed companies in the securities11Securities and Exchange Board of Indiamarket has grown many folds as compared to growth in non-food bank credit (which is taken as an indicator of economic growth) in last decade. MIIs constitute the nucleus of capital allocation system and are indispensable for economic growth. They are therefore, vital economic infrastructure. The recent financial crisis has shown the importance of financial institutions to economic stability. Unlike typical financial institutions, the number of stock exchanges / depositories / clearing corporations in an economy is limited due to the nature of its business, although catering to the entire marketplace. Any failure of such an MII could lead to even bigger cataclysmic collapses that may result in an overall economic downfall that could potentially extend beyond the boundaries of the securities market/country. Therefore, such MIIs are considered systemically important institutions.1.4. MIIs AS PRODUCERS OF PUBLIC GOODThe price signals produced by the MIIs partake of the character of public good as these are something that must be provided and accessible to every one and cannot be withheld from anyone who seeks it. Therefore, essentially, the three MIIs in the securities holding-trading-clearing-settlement chain are engaged in the business of producing a valuable public good for society, which are essentially the price signals produced by a transparent and efficient market mechanism. The product that flows from the coordinated functioning of the three MIIs is at the core of modern financial systems. They are the vital to the functioning of the market.The prices discovered through the operation of these MIIs have to be fair, failing which, they will result in the expropriation of unjust profits by any one side of the transaction. Corporates and Investment Funds use these price signals to value their investments and mark them to market. The Net Asset Value of a Mutual Fund, which guides investments and redemptions by investors, directly12Securities and Exchange Board of Indiareads off the prices discovered. The valuation of securities collaterals pledged in most modern day credit based finance is inextricably linked to the public good that these MIIs produce.These are but a few of the numerous ways in which the efficient functioning of these institutions underpins a modern financial market. These institutions, though recognised for providing the markets with the necessary infrastructure, cannot be treated mechanically merely as suppliers of infrastructure, however, they are to be viewed more as institutions which are suppliers of an indispensable public good for modern society. Needless to say, the public good product that is supplied collectively by the MIIs is exclusively dependent on the quality and integrity of the process that accompanies the production of the same. Hence, to ensure dependability of the process to the fullest extent possible, certain degree of regulatory powers have to necessarily reside in each of the MIIs, albeit in varying degrees. Therefore, the Committee is of the view that it is not possible to sever the regulatory role of the MIIs from their more obvious role of serving as providers of infrastructure of the market.Having observed this, it will be useful, in this context, to examine the characteristics and function of each class of MII first, before taking up the governance and ownership structures appropriate to them.1.5. STOCK EXCHANGEStock exchanges provide transaction facility to investors and thus discover the price of securities traded on them. Prices provide the signal for efficient allocation of financial resources across corporations. In this sense, the role of stock exchanges in efficient allocation of resource in the economy is of great significance.13Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaA stock exchange under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as SCRA) means:(a)\tany body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, constituted beforecorporatisation and demutualisation under sections 4A and 4B, or(b) a body corporate incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 whether under a scheme of corporatisation and demutualisation or otherwise, for the purpose of assisting, regulating or controlling the business of buying, selling or dealing in securities.Traditionally, under the open outcry system, a stock exchange was understood to be a place where buyers and sellers met in order to buy/sell securities. Over time, technology has replaced the open outcry system and automated trade engines execute trades based on a price time priority or any other algorithm. To trade through a stock exchange, the investor has to become a client of a registered trading member of a particular stock exchange. Stock exchanges have been entrusted with various regulatory responsibilities for ensuring market integrity and for protecting the interest of investors. Stock exchanges therefore cannot be seen only as providers of electronic platforms for executing trades.A stock exchange apart from providing electronic platforms for executing trades performs a number of other functions such as:^\tissuer regulation (listing, monitoring listing compliances, dissemination of information)^\tmember regulation (registration of members, inspection and enforcement action)^\ttrading regulation (setting and enforcing trading rules, market surveillance) and^\tinvestor protection (dispute resolution, grievance redressal, investor protection fund)14Securities and Exchange Board of India^\tproduct designStock exchanges also undertake support functions such as training and education, technology solutions, data/information services and index services.EvolutionStock exchanges in India have a history of more than 160 years and have evolved over a long period. The first and oldest stock exchange in Asia was set up in 1850s, as the records reveal, by indigenous brokers under a Banyan tree which later on in 1875 became what is known today as Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE) was recognised in the year 1993. Recently, two stock exchanges  MCX Stock Exchange Limited (MCX-SX) (2008) and United Stock Exchange of India Limited (USE) (2010) have been recognised and have been permitted for trading in currency derivatives. In addition, there are 17 regional stock exchanges that have negligible or no trading, at present.The governance of stock exchanges has also undergone significant changes over time. Except for NSE, OTCEI, MCX-SX and USE, all other stock exchanges in India were initially set up as associations of persons. These four stock exchanges were set up ab initio as companies with limited liability. During the period 200006, stock exchanges worldwide underwent a process of corporatisation and demutualisation. Mutual stock exchanges that were owned by its members were restructured in order to reduce the trading members influence over the management of the stock exchange and open up stock exchanges to greater public ownership. It was felt that diversified public ownership is the way forward. These mutual stock exchanges were formed as associations of persons, wherein the membership card bestowed both ownership and trading rights on the brokers; the brokers because of their ownership rights invariably exercised control over the management of the stock exchanges too. The stock exchanges15Securities and Exchange Board of Indiawere in dire need of professional and independent management. The corporate structure was therefore chosen because it is intrinsically a form that allows wider participation of shareholders, is backed by an established legal framework under the Companies Act, 1956 and above all enables a clear-cut three-way segregation of ownership, management and trading rights.The SCRA was amended in the year 2004 for mandating corporatisation and demutualisation of stock exchanges in India. The Securities Contracts (Manner of Increasing and Maintaining Public Shareholding in Recognised Stock Exchanges) Regulations, 2006 (referred to as MIMPS hereinafter) was notified, wherein, shareholding limits were inter alia, prescribed in order to ensure diversified ownership (including public shareholding) of stock exchanges, and the manner in which such diversification has to be achieved were also laid down.MIMPS prescribed representation of various participants on the board of stock exchanges and restricted the collective representation of trading members on the board of a stock exchange upto a maximum of 25%.1.6. CLEARING CORPORATIONAs per the draft5 Rules, clearing corporation means a company incorporatedunder the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956) for the purpose of-(i)\tthe periodical settlement of contracts and differences there under;(ii)\tthe delivery of, and payment for, securities;(iii)\tany other matter incidental to, or connected with, such transfer and recognised as a clearing corporation under these rules.A clearing corporation performs the functions of clearing and settlement of trades that are executed on the stock exchange platform. Settlement of trades involves ensuring that the net obligations that have been determined at the16Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaclearing member level (a clearing member clears and settles trades on behalf of self and other trading members) are settled. As per the terms of the transaction executed on the stock exchange, the clearing corporation interposes itself between the buyer and the seller and undertakes to fulfill the obligations on behalf of the counterparties to the transaction. For ensuring settlement, the clearing corporation adopts stringent risk management practices to ensure settlement of obligations. The risk management function aims to reduce the chances of default during settlement. However, no system howsoever robust it may be, is fail proof. By its role, even if there is failure/default by any member to meet its liability, the clearing corporation has to meet its liability to all others. In such an eventuality, it makes pay-out of funds on behalf of the defaulter (in case of funds shortage) and obtains securities through auction buy-in (in case of securities shortage). Thus ensuring that the system does not have any counterparty risk.A well functioning clearing corporation is the most important element of risk management in the securities markets. The regulatory responsibilities of a clearing corporation include:^\tsettlement guarantee/ novation^\tsound risk management^\tmember regulation (registration of members, inspection and enforcement action)EvolutionUnder the open outcry system, the stock exchange was a place where buyers and sellers used to negotiate the terms of trade and the transactions were bilaterally settled between the parties to the trade. With the emergence of technology and sound risk management measures, multilateral clearing and settlement and guaranteeing of trades is now carried out by the clearing corporation/clearing17Securities and Exchange Board of Indiahouse, while the stock exchange provides electronic, anonymous, order driven platforms for execution of trades.Presently clearing and settlement for trades executed on stock exchanges is undertaken either by a clearing house or by a clearing corporation. Sound risk management practices have been adopted by both clearing houses (of functioning stock exchanges) and clearing corporations in India. However, since the clearing corporation/ clearing house guarantees the settlement of the trades, its net worth can also be utilized in the event of insufficiency of funds during a default. In extreme scenarios, the impact on the networth could be very high. Such depletion of networth may call for infusion of new capital or otherwise may lead to winding down of the entity. In such an event, if the clearing function is vested with a separate independent entity, it can facilitate usage of its net worth in extreme scenarios without having an adverse impact on the stock exchange. Whereas, in case it is part of the stock exchange, the net worth of stock exchange is directly and automatically impacted under such extreme scenarios of default. This will affect normal operation/functioning of stock exchange. If the clearing corporation is a separate legal entity, the risk to the capital of the clearing corporation will be segregated and will not spillover to the stock exchange, which appears to be a distinct improvement over the clearing house model.Traditionally, stock exchanges in India set up their own clearing houses for clearing and settlement of their trades. NSE and MCX-SX have set up independent entities for clearing their trades. BSE has also recently set up an independent entity for clearing and settlement of certain classes of securities traded at BSE and clears and settles for USE too.The SCRA was amended in 2004 for providing for recognition of clearing corporations. The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 (hereinafter18Securities and Exchange Board of Indiareferred to as SCRR) are in the process of being amended. Comprehensive legal framework in being put in place for prescribing the eligibility criteria, procedure for recognition, terms of recognition, membership conditions, etc for clearing corporations.1.7. DEPOSITORYA \"Depository\" is an entity facilitating holding securities in electronic form and enables transfer of securities by book entry. It interacts with its clients through a `Depository Participant', with whom the client is required to open a demat account. The main objective of depository is to provide maintenance of ownership or transfer records of securities in an electronic book entry form resulting in paper-less trading rather than paper-based trading and to ensure transferability of securities with speed, accuracy and safety.As per the Depositories Act, 1996, a depository means a company formed and registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and which has been granted a certificate of registration under sub-section (1A) of section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992);A depository performs the following regulatory functions;^\tdepository participants regulation (registration, inspection and enforcement action)^\tadmission of securities, dematerialisation, rematerialisation^\tmaintenance of register of beneficial owners, record keeping / book entry of transfers^\tinvestor protection (dispute resolution and grievance redressal) EvolutionLimitations and problems associated with paper based ownership of securities and settlement necessitated setting up of depositories. The paper based trading19Securities and Exchange Board of Indiasystem was neither investor friendly nor scalable and was riddled with problems of bad deliveries, delays, forgery and failure of settlements occasionally. Movement of large volume of papers required longer settlement cycles and was not cost effective.The enactment of the Depositories Act, 1996 paved the way for the establishment of depositories for the purpose of electronic record of ownership. Following the notification of the SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996, National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL), a company sponsored by the NSE, IDBI and UTI was granted a certificate of registration as a depository on June 7, 1996. Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL), the second depository, which was promoted by BSE along with financial institutions and banks, was granted certificate of registration on August 19, 1998. Inter-depository transfer through on-line connectivity between CDSL and NSDL was established in 1999. With the introduction of the depository system, problems associated with the paper based trading and settlement system were resolved and it paved way to growth in the securities market and was a step forward in making the market place safe and secure.1.8. APPROACHFunctionally, MIIs provide the basic network of equipment, facility, system or services for the securities market, hence, MIIs are seen as public utilities. As regards ownership of MIIs, all of them are privately owned and structured as companies with limited liability. Although MIIs are seen as public utilities, most MIIs are profit-oriented. In addition, being in direct proximity to the market, MIIs are treated as first-level regulators and have been vested with regulatory responsibilities by various statutes. Countries differ in the manner in which they view MIIs in their jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions across the world see these MIIs as regulatory institutions, which have to be economically viable as well.20Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaOther jurisdictions that see them more as commercial entities, also exercise an incidental regulatory role. It would appear that these differences are rooted in the history of the evolution of individual securities markets, the governance mechanisms, the levels of transparency and integrity that a jurisdiction has inherited historically and the evolution of legislative action and jurisprudence pertinent to institutions. These differences are more discernible in the case of stock exchanges and clearing corporations and less so in the case of depositories.While the Committee agrees that the MIIs are economic entities that have to be capable of sustaining themselves, the core facets to MIIs are as follows:1. In general, MIIs are in the nature of public utilities.2. All of them are vested with regulatory responsibilities, in varying degrees.3. They have systemic importance to the economy.The three attributes listed above have differing and sometimes conflicting goals.As\ta public utility, an MII becomes an organization that maintainsthe infrastructure (the trading avenues and platforms and other services incidental to this) for a public service (running a market for securities trading). Clearly6, the goals of profit maximization for an MII and that of welfare maximization for the public (in this case, the investors that make up the securities market) may not always run parallel and the MII may be tempted to charge prices well in excess of costs from its users. Moreover, at least in the short run, the regulatory goals may be in conflict with the economic interests 7 of a stock exchange. As it may, in many instances, be required to discipline its members and issuers who are the source of its income. However, in the long run, it may actually be economically prudent for the MII if it establishes itself as a provider of safe and reliable market place.21Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaA concern has been expressed that post-demutualization, stock exchanges have become for-profit companies and have therefore, become free to pursue their economic interest objectives and hence, their focus on regulatory activities have been diluted. However, this view does not go uncontested as there are persons who believe that the demutualization of a stock exchange is not necessarily incompatible with self-regulation. The ability of the stock exchange to meet the standards set for it and deliver key regulatory and public interest objectives depends on a range of factors including the overall regulatory framework, the stock exchanges obligations under the law, the formulation, administration and enforcement of its listing and trading rules, its formal and informal arrangements with the statutory regulator, its management structure, the de facto versus de jure control within it, the transparency of its decision making processes, its allocation of resources for particular regulatory functions and the experience and quality of its staff. In addition, the capacity and the willingness of the statutory regulator to perform its supervisory role are key to the success of the regulatory framework8.Nevertheless, the multiple roles played by the stock exchange could pose conflicts of interests in its operations. Regulators across the globe have adopted different methods9 to address these conflicts.(i)\tGovernment (Statutory) Model: Regulation is performed by a public authority. Formal SROs do not exist. Stock exchanges are responsible for very limited supervision of their markets. Examples: UK(FSA), France (AMF).(ii)\tLimited Exchange SRO Model: A public authority is the primary regulator; it relies on stock exchange(s) to perform certain regulatory functions tied to the operation of its market. The function of regulating its members is not performed by the stock exchange. The stock exchange22Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaonly performs surveillance functions. Examples: Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Sweden.(iii)\tStrong Exchange SRO Model: A public authority is the primary regulator, it relies on Exchange(s) to perform extensive regulatory functions that extend beyond its market operations, including regulating members business conduct. Examples: US (CME), Australia (ASX), Japan (TSE, OSE), Malaysia (Bursa Malaysia).(iv)\tIndependent SRO Model: A public authority is the primary regulator, it relies extensively on an independent SRO (a member organization that is not a market operator) to perform extensive regulatory functions. Examples: US (FINRA& NFA), Canada (IDA & MFDA), Japan (JSDA), Columbia (AMV).These four models represent various points along a continuum. The specific choice is governed by several factors including the size of the market and the history of development of markets and financial institutions.India has adopted the strong exchange SRO model. It is premature to think of the independent SRO model in the Indian context given its evolution over a period to its present state; the government model may not be entirely possible in the Indian context considering the size of the market. However, due to the potential conflict of interest in the strong exchange SRO model, the Committee is of the view that SEBI must take a more active role in setting a level playing field with regard to fees, entry, etc. of members of MIIs.1.9. DESIRABLE FEATURES OF MIIsMarket outcomes that are desirable should be the guiding parameters forformulating the ownership and governance norms for MIIs. The discussion in23Securities and Exchange Board of Indiathe preceding paragraphs leads one to believe that the following outcomes are desirable:1.\tNational interest and economic security should be safeguarded2.\tThe MIIs should serve as elements of vital economic infrastructure for efficient resource allocation in the economy3.\tMIIs should serve as instruments of managing market risks and to the extent possible prevent market failure4. There should be desire/motivation/incentives for the operators of MII to support orderly market development that provides long term market stability5. The MIIs should reduce the regulatory burden of the market by effectively supporting the market regulator6.\tThe systems adopted by the MII should provide transparency and equal access to its participants.In line with the approach outlined above on the nature of MIIs, the Committee feels that in the current state of market development in India, following are the appropriate features of a well functioning MII:(i)\tSelf-financing: A well managed MII should be capable of financing itself and providing for its sustenance in the near future.(ii) Make reasonable profits: The MII should endeavor to generate reasonable profits in order to be self-sustaining. The MII should levy reasonable charges on its users without abusing its dominant or regulatory position.(iii) Regulatory function: The MII should be capable of undertaking adequate level of regulatory activities in an unbiased manner. The MII should not shy away from investing adequately in its regulatory activities. The MII must establish itself as a fair and strong regulator and24Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaearn the trust and goodwill of the marketplace so that it is actually profitable for the MII to be a good regulator in its domain of business.(iv) Settlement guarantee fund/investor protection fund: The MII should provide adequate safety to the market place by having a sufficiently capitalized settlement guarantee fund/investor protection fund. This fund should be adequate to meet perceived contingencies and black swan events.(v) Net worth: The MII should be a well-capitalized entity so that the net worth of the MII is available as a last resort to meet exigencies and ensure that it is able to remain as a going concern.(vi) Professional standards and competitive practices: The MII must maintain the same professional standards in all its dealings including dealings with its competitors, its technology providers and related entities. It must be able to maintain its integrity by being unbiased while dealing with all such entities.(vii) Transparency: The MII should maintain utmost transparency in its operations. The MII on its website should at least make disclosures that are mandated for a listed company.(viii) Technology: All the three MIIs are heavily dependent on technology. The MII should be willing to invest in technology for increasing efficiency, reach and economies of scale.1.10. CONCERNSThe regulatory framework for the securities market in India has evolved over the years. However, in this progression, the markets have seen two events of significant market failure. Parliament has intervened in both these instances to constitute a Joint Parliamentary Committees (JPC) to look into various aspects, regulatory and otherwise. The recommendations of these committees have contributed to further strengthening the regulatory framework associated with25Securities and Exchange Board of Indiasecurities markets. Certain fundamental issues need to be revisited in the light of existing market scenario to ensure that the regulatory framework keeps pace with the challenges posed by developments of securities markets.1. Need for strategic investors/owners in the MIIs:There is no established opinion in the literature to arrive at what would be the optimum number of each class of MII in a given securities market. However, as mentioned before, MIIs share several characteristics of natural monopolies. Hence, it is very important to create enabling conditions that allow new entrants to enter the market, albeit, after satisfying regulatory preconditions. At present, the shareholding rights are restricted to 5% for a single entity and extended to 15% for specific classes of institutions. This was done to obviate the possibility of concentration of ownership in a few hands. The cap on shareholding (at 5 and 15 %) has led to a situation where a single entity may not be interested in furthering the growth of the stock exchange because of its limited ownership interest in the stock exchange. Due to relatively low shareholding limit, the incentive (in terms of management control and commercial benefit) that is available to a single investor may not be sufficient for it to devote the requisite time and energy to further the operational interests of the stock exchange. Consequently, this could hinder the growth of the securities market. At the same time, the need to encourage strategic investors has to be balanced against the need for ensuring the profit maximization behavior of the MII or any shareholder does not jeopardize the safety of the market.2. MIIs as for profit organizations:As elaborated earlier, the role of the MII as a public utility and firstlevel regulator may sometimes not be in harmony with its26Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaeconomic interests of maximizing its profits. On the contrary, the motivation of the owners of MIIs should be to make only reasonable profits. Motivation should arise from the desire to establish the market infrastructure and run it in a clean, efficient fashion. This calls for credible players, willingness to remain invested for long periods, expectation of reasonable dividends/returns, inclination to reinvest excess profits in the MII with a view to provide a safety net to the market to meet even the most adverse market disturbance. It is also necessary to ensure that no shareholder dominates the MII in terms of ownership or management control. There should be predominance of desire on the part of the shareholders of an MII to play an institutional role rather than seeking commercial gains in the short/long run. Given the importance of the MIIs as components of social infrastructure, national interest should be safeguarded in specifying ownership/management control.Recently, new products such as currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives have increased the number of players in the MII space and the competition among these players. In an increasingly competitive environment, stock exchanges may even be tempted to misuse their regulatory powers while regulating/dealing with its competitors (when the competitor is registered as its member or is a potential technology provider, etc), under-invest in regulatory activities, use its regulatory income for unrelated commercial purposes10, etc. The question under consideration is whether the governance structure of the MII needs to be altered for ensuring that it serves the purpose for which it was created.27Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaFurther, the following developments also raise questions on the suitability of the existing organizational structure:-^\tnew market structures involving alliances of stock exchanges,^\toutsourcing of clearing and settlement,^\tproposals to bring OTC transactions on to the stock exchange platform,^\tstock exchanges setting up technology and other related businesses3. Separation of clearing function of a Stock Exchange and entrusting it to an independent clearing corporation:It is to be examined whether the close relationship between the stock exchange and clearing corporation is an issue. Other questions related to a clearing corporation are its eligibility criteria such as net worth requirements.4. Self listing by a stock exchange and possible conflicts of interest:Privately held stock exchanges seek to be listed in order to provide an exit route to its shareholders. However, listing of stock exchange gives rise to a host of other issues, the most pertinent one being the issue of who would be responsible for monitoring the listing compliances. The committee deliberated on the issue as to whether an MII be allowed to list in view of the inherent conflict of interest.5. Likelihood of unfair practices in allowing selective access to price sensitive data to market participants and stock exchange resources:The present board composition for stock exchanges permits up to 25% of the board of the stock exchange to be represented by trading members. At least 25% of the board is to be comprised of public interest directors (PID) and the balance is to be represented by shareholder directors. The trading members on the board of the28Securities and Exchange Board of Indiastock exchange are in a privileged position as compared to other trading members and may gain access to confidential information, which is not available to others. The Committee deliberated on the governing board structure prescribed for stock exchanges and felt that it needs to be reviewed.6. Management compensation and accountability of senior management:There is a general belief that among others, the compensation practices at financial institutions was one of the factors that contributed to the global financial crisis. Certain compensation related incentive structures encouraged excessive risk taking, particularly those of senior management, without adequate regard to the resultant longer-term risks on the institutions. This incentive structure had the effect of privatizing profits while socializing losses. This excessive risk-taking left institutions with lower levels of resources to absorb losses as risks actually devolved. It has to be examined in the context of MIIs as to whether the incentive structures for key management personnel needs to be regulated by specifying certain broad parameters / guidelines.1.11. ISSUESBased on the above concerns, the Committee has identified the following issuesfor deliberation with respect to the ownership and governance norms for MIIs:-1. What is a stock exchange? Does the definition of stock exchange need any modification?2. Do the present ownership restrictions on MIIs need review? Do FII/FDI norms on ownership in an MII need to be reviewed?29Securities and Exchange Board of India3. Which is a better model for ownership?  (a) Diversified ownership (as in the case of stock exchanges) or (b) anchor/strategic investor approach (as in the case of depositories)a. In case (b) is suitable for MIIs, what classes of entities can be permitted to be anchor investors?b. Should there be lock-in stipulations for anchor investor?c. What are the conflicts arising out of private entities becoming anchor investors?4.\t\tDoes the present Board composition (including manner of appointment ofthe Board) prescribed by SEBI for stock exchanges need a review? Should the same be extended to other MIIs?5. Trading Members on the Board of the Stock Exchange can potentially have access to confidential information with respect to trading information pertaining to other members as well as sensitive information. Should there be any trading member representation on the Board of the Stock Exchange, or alternatively, can they be put on a separate Advisory Board to the main Board?6. What should be the organizational structure for an MII that is suitable for fulfilling the objectives of an MII including its regulatory goals? Can the conflicts of interest be eliminated through specific stipulations of structure and governance of MIIs? (For e.g., erection of Chinese wall between the two functions or hiving it off to a subsidiary or transferring to a regulatory body)?7. What other businesses should an MII be allowed to perform? Can they set up another MII with 100% shareholding? What kind of non-MII businesses can they perform? Can they set up related businesses such as independent software vendors?8. In the light of the recent global financial crisis and the debate on management compensation, is there a case for enunciating principles for30Securities and Exchange Board of Indiamanagement compensation of MIIs? What should the management be accountable for  profitability, regulatory efficiency, etc.?9. What should be the process of appointment of senior management in MIIs? What other safeguards are to be put in the management structure?10. What will be an optimal number of MIIs for the Indian Securities Market? What should be entry and exit norms applicable to MIIs?11. There are twin dangers for all MIIs  regulatory race to the bottom in the face of competition or becoming too big to fail. What safeguards can be built to prevent the same?12. Are there any regulatory issues arising out of competition such as discrimination by an MII against a competing MII or any intermediary or technology provider that needs to be regulated? What should be the norms to regulate the relationship of MII with technology providers and intermediaries?13. To what extent should commercial functions of an MII be regulated? Specifically, should charges and fees levied by MIIs be regulated in a competitive environment? Is there a case for capping the charges on a cost plus basis and/or for capping distribution of profits?14. Whether listing of an MII should be permitted? If so, what would be best model that may be permitted  self-listing, cross listing or dual listing? What are the alternatives to achieve these objectives? Are there any issues arising out of listing of a subsidiary of the MII on the same MII?15. Should clearing corporations be subsidiaries of stock exchanges or should they be completely separate entities? What should be the ownership restrictions for clearing corporations?16.\tWhat should be net worth requirement for a clearing corporation?17.\tIs it desirable to allow Stock Exchanges, by virtue of being a sponsor of the depository to own more than 50% of the ownership of Depositories, thus31Securities and Exchange Board of Indialeading to a situation where the depository becomes a subsidiary/ group company of the Stock Exchange?1.12. STRUCTURE OF THE REPORTThe above issues have been grouped under the following chapters in this report:-I. Ownership norms: This chapter reviews the existing ownership norms including foreign participation in stock exchanges and depositories and also proposes norms for clearing corporations.II.\tGovernance norms: The board composition for the three MIIs is examinedin this Chapter.III. Measures for conflicts resolution: This chapter deals with appointment and compensation for senior management, measures to ensure autonomy of regulatory departments and requirements for a compliance officer.IV. Other issues: This chapter deals with listing of MIIs, net worth requirements , requirement on MIIs to generate only reasonable profits , related businesses that can be entered into by MIIs, replacement of MIMPS Regulations and powers to SEBI in matters relating to MIIs.In each of the following chapters, the three MIIs are dealt with separately so that issues can be examined in context to the specific nuances of each MII. The recommendations of the Committee on each issue are stated at the end of the relevant section.32Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaChapter IIOwnership norms2.1 MARKET STRUCTUREA discussion on ownership norms for MIIs has necessarily to be placed in the backdrop of the broad market structure that determines the inter-MIIs linkages in terms of their ownership and control.Generally two types of market structures are observed i.e., vertical silos or horizontal integration. Silo models imply vertical integration across the trading and post-trading value chain (trading systems, clearing houses and central depositories). Historically, in most markets, this has been the case in the initial stages of their evolution. This was so because the stock exchanges took the first steps in building post-trade infrastructures to replace bilateral and paper based settlement arrangements for formalized and multilateral clearing and settlement schemes. Horizontal models in most cases, have been the result of the merger of institutions providing the same layer of services in the trade value chain (e.g. trade matching, clearing, settlement, central depository). The distinctive feature is that they are designed to interact with multiple providers of trade and post-trade services11.Competition between stock exchanges may be precluded if potential new entrant stock exchanges and trading systems are restricted from having the same access to clearing and settlement facilities as incumbent stock exchanges. This may occur if competition for the provisions of clearing or settlement services is limited or non-existent and the incumbent stock exchange operates a vertical silo, in which it owns the clearing corporation and the depository. If an incumbent stock exchange operates a vertical silo, but competition at both the clearing and33Securities and Exchange Board of Indiasettlement level is viable, then a new entrant stock exchange has the option of creating its own vertical silo with a clearing corporation and a depository or alternatively seek the services of a clearing corporation and depository other than those owned by the incumbent stock exchange. If an incumbent stock exchange operates a vertical silo and the provision of clearing and settlement services is not competitive, it may choose to be restrictive in offering access to its clearing corporation and depository to a competing stock exchange thereby hindering competition at the trading level12.However, the question as to whether a vertically integrated stock exchange will seek to restrict access to its clearing corporation to another stock exchange is debatable. A major concern expressed by many market participants is that in a world where outsourced clearing is becoming increasingly common, there is a real fear that a clearing corporation may be biased toward its dominant stock exchange customers. This concern is arguably greater for those clearing corporations that remain captive to one major stock exchange or group of stock exchanges but provide outsourced clearing on a selective basis to outsiders. A captive clearing corporation, for example, might be tempted to approve new contracts much faster for its primary stock exchange affiliate than for its outsourcing customers. This would suggest that there is merit in encouraging setting up of a fully independent clearing corporation that caters to more than one stock exchange13.In practice, however, the concerns expressed above have not manifested in any significant manner as seen from several instances in the securities markets in different jurisdictions.14 It has also been argued15 that if one were to assume that execution is potentially highly competitive and if clearing were a natural monopoly, then the monopoly clearing entity would encourage competition in execution rather than insist that market users use the trading system of the34Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaassociated stock exchange. If other execution venues are more efficient and if competition between them drives down the price of execution services, the clearing monopolist would be better off not integrating execution and clearing and instead allowing customers to obtain execution services from the lowest-cost provider.Vertical integration  the combination of both clearing and execution activities in a single firm as a vertical silo  eliminates double markups and can be a means to economize on transaction costs16. Thus, typically, fundamental economic considerations appear to that make vertical integration a more prevalent route in comparison to the alternative of trading and post-trading services being provided by separate for-profit entities.In India, vertical silos have so far emerged in both clearing and depository services. NSE has a 100% owned subsidiary NSCCL for clearing and settlement services. NSE also holds 25% in NSDL. Similarly, BSE has a clearinghouse for clearing and settlement of its products. It has also set up an independent 100% owned clearing corporation, ICCL, for clearing and settlement of some of its segments. BSE has 54% shareholding in CDSL. However, this arrangement has not precluded access to the respective depositories. Inter-connectivity between NSDL and CDSL has been achieved in 1999, albeit through regulatory intervention. MCX-SX has also set up a 100% owned subsidiary MCX-SXCCL for clearing and settlement. However, USE, the latest stock exchange in the securities market, has outsourced clearing and settlement to ICCL. BSE holds 15% of the paid up equity capital of USE .From the above, it is evident that both trade execution and post-trade services have proven to be competitively viable in the Indian scenario17. Moreover, outsourcing of clearing and settlement is also gradually emerging in the Indian35Securities and Exchange Board of Indiamarket. It appears that there is no pressing need to alter the exiting market structure of arrangement between stock exchanges, clearing corporation and depository solely to address the issue of competition.The ownership requirements of each MII are examined below.2.2\tSTOCK EXCHANGES: The ownership requirements for stock exchangeswere notified by Government of India vide SCR (Manner of Increasing and Maintaining Public Shareholding) Regulations, 2006 (MIMPS). The following limits are applicable as per the MIMPS Regulations:-Category\tMaximum Permitted HoldingPerson resident in India  individual\t5%limitStock exchange, depository, clearing corporation, banking company and a public financial institution defined under Sec. 4 A of the Companies Act 195618\t15%Persons residing outside India  individual limit\t5%Limit on cumulative holding by trading members \t49%Persons residing outside India  cumulative limit\t49%, subject further to the following:-a) 26% through the FDI (via FIPB approval)b) 23% for FIIs (No initial allotment through an IPO/FPO)If the stock exchanges are not listed, acquisition by FII is permitted through off market transactions but not through initial allotment.If the stock exchange is listed, acquisition by FII is permitted only through on market.36Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaAnnexure  C & Annexure D of this report depict the ownership restrictions in select countries and details of ownership of stock exchanges in select countries, respectively. It is seen that the existing shareholding restrictions in India generally are similar to that of most other countries. However, from the tables in Annexure D, it is seen that in most of the other stock exchanges, at least one shareholder has been permitted to hold more than 15% but less than 30% of the equity share capital.Imposing restrictions on ownership is one of the ways of exercising regulatory control over a stock exchange. Dispersed ownership structure has been adopted for stock exchanges so that no single entity becomes a dominant shareholder in an entity that is entrusted with vital economic and regulatory functions. It has been felt that for public policy reasons19, it is desirable to encourage widespread ownership, encompassing both institutional and retail investors. This helps to reduce the likelihood of decisions being made in the interests of any one particular segment of the market.However, there have also been contrary views expressed in this regard. Demutualization was aimed at allowing a stock exchange to operate as an entity in its own right  rather than as an extension of its members/users business. Ownership and control in the stock exchange of the trading members has been restricted severely. This in a sense has shifted the governance fulcrum away from the trading members to the shareholders and public interest directors. But some observers20 have noted that limiting the maximum permissible holding by other entities (to limits as low as 5 percent of share capital of that stock exchange) might have led to the lack of interest on the part of shareholders to take adequate interest in the management and governance of the stock exchanges. Thus the limits on shareholding of a stock exchange, could defeat the purpose of37Securities and Exchange Board of Indiademutualization. Indeed, in the case of some stock exchanges, it appears that in spite of demutualising, they have been unable to shake the conflicts between members who have different interests.It has also been suggested21 that there are number of factors that could influence a stock exchange to seek to limit diversified ownership, including:(i) Very widely dispersed ownership, where investors are more likely than not, to suffer from rational apathy in their decision-making, which may possibly have adverse consequences on occasions when a requisite level of extant shareholders is needed, for example, where a change to a stock exchanges constitution is required, and(ii) Relatively large shareholder bases are likely to impose significant ongoing costs on stock exchange which arise from the need to service shareholders, for example, by providing them with annual reports, general meeting venues and so on;On examining the above arguments, the Committee is of the opinion that the concept of dispersed ownership is to be favored for the well functioning of the stock exchanges. However, institutions fulfilling stringent eligibility criteria may be permitted to hold a higher percentage of shareholding in stock exchanges. In India, the shareholding restrictions prescribed under MIMPs were increased from 5% to 15% for certain class of investors in 2008. The question now under consideration is whether a further step in that direction is warranted. This issue is being considered mainly because there may be certain shareholders fulfilling stringent eligibility, fit and proper criteria, who take an interest in the working of the stock exchange, and may be interested to obtain higher shareholding. Further, possibly there is still scope for new stock exchanges to be set up in India,38Securities and Exchange Board of Indiagiven the huge expected potential of its markets. It is desirable to ensure that fair competition is available to avoid perverse monopoly. At the same time, the Committee is of the opinion that the optimal number of stock exchanges required in India cannot be arrived at with any degree of precision. Moreover, entry of a large number of stock exchanges will fragment liquidity to such an extent that this might stifle growth and innovation in the process. Also, too frequent exits of stock exchanges will jeopardize the interests of the investors and disrupt the stability of the markets themselves. Further, technology has altered the market place so much that need for multiple stock exchanges has been reduced largely.The concept of anchor investors is not alien to Indian securities market, as it has been introduced by SEBI on July 9, 2009, in public issues, to help the issuer to raise funds. The Committee therefore proposes to support the concept of Anchor Institutional Investor who will take the lead role of setting up a stock exchange. However, the implementation of the above proposal should not result in the dilution of dispersed ownership norms for stock exchanges. Therefore, it is suggested that there should be a cap on the maximum shareholding held by all anchor institutional investors put together. In addition, the anchor institutional investor should bring down his shareholding within a prescribed period.At present, the MIMPS Regulations permit the following entities to hold up to 15%, after seeking prior approval from SEBI:-(i)\tStock Exchange(ii) Depository(iii)\tClearing corporation39Securities and Exchange Board of India(iv) Banking company as defined under clause (c) of section 5 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(v)\tInsurance company as defined under sub-section (8) of section 2 of theInsurance Act, 1938(vi) Public financial institution defined under section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956Of the above entities, well-capitalized public financial institutions and banks may only be permitted to be anchor institutional investors for stock exchanges. While in Section 5.5 of the report the Committee has proposed the replacement of the MIMPS Regulations by a comprehensive set of regulations on the ownership and governance of stock exchange, the following changes are recommended to the current set of provisions of the MIMPS Regulations applicable to stock exchanges:-I. ANCHOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR (AII)a) Domestic institutions registered in India having a net worth of ` 1000 crores or more and falling under the category of:(i) Public Financial institutions defined under section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956 and with national jurisdiction,(ii) Banking company as defined under clause (c) of section 5 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949may be permitted to be anchor institutional investors for stock exchanges for a period of 10 years from the date of recognition as an AII of the exchange.40Securities and Exchange Board of Indiab) Public financial institutions and banking companies fulfilling the conditions prescribed under (a) above can be anchor institutional investors even if their subsidiary/ associates have trading interests.c) A single anchor institutional investor may be permitted to hold up to 24% of the total equity capital of an exchange, along with persons acting in concert.d) Every anchor institutional investor will have to bring down its holding to 15% or less in ten years from the time it is recognised as an anchor. During the allowed holding period of ten years, if an AII desires to offload the stake to another eligible AII, the holding period for new AII would be deemed to have commenced from the date when original AII acquired shares and became AII. In summary, the total holding period allowed will be only 10 years for the initial AII and its subsequent AIIs. SEBI may extend such period in case the AII makes an application for the extension in time and the same is a fit case for extension.e) Anchor Institutional Investor for new stock exchanges: At the time of filing the application for recognition as a stock exchange, anchor institutional investors shall be identified, by the entity seeking recognition, from amongst the shareholders holding more than 15% and up to 24% of the equity capital of the exchange.f) Anchor Institutional Investor for existing stock exchanges: Entities at (a) above desirous of holding more than 15% and up to 24% for becoming anchor institutional investors in a recognised stock exchange will have to make an application to SEBI for the same after getting the approval of41Securities and Exchange Board of Indiathe shareholders in the AGM of the stock exchange through a special resolution.g) All anchor institutional investors put together shall not hold more than 49% of the total equity capital of an exchange.h) The present procedure of obtaining fit and proper approval from SEBI, for entities holding more than 5% shall continue.II. OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF AN MII IN ANOTHER CLASS OF MIIIn the securities market in India, the evolution of vertical silos with stock exchanges holding stakes in clearing corporation and depositories has become quite prevalent. The Committee is of the view that clearing corporations and depositories perform specialized post-trade services. It is ideal for these MIIs (clearing corporations and depositories) to function as public utilities and focus on improving the safety of the market and reducing the costs to users. The Committee is of the view that on account of the discussions in section 2.1 above, there is no need to permit a clearing corporation or depository to invest in other class of MIIs. Hence, clearing corporations and depositories may not be allowed to invest in other class of MIIs .42Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaTo sum up, the model proposed for restriction on shareholding of stock exchanges is as follows:-Upto 5%\t>5% and upto 15%\tANCHOR INSTITUTIONALINVESTOR>15% and upto 24%Any\tperson\tboth\ta.\tStock Exchange\tDomestic institutions22\thaving a netresident in India and\tb.

A single independent clearing corporation is ideal for obtaining the benefits of netting and for position monitoring purposes as well. However, it would also increase the systemic risk in the market. A mid-way would be to have multiple independent clearing corporations, which are connected to each other and to the exchanges and depositories. This would necessitate interoperability among clearing corporations. As established by the example of depositories in India, a majority holding by a stock exchange does not preclude successful linkages between the depositories. Moreover, from a market power perspective, a single clearing corporation may levy excessive charges on its users.As regards ownership issues, while stock exchanges are required to increase penetration and turnover, the business of a clearing corporation is only a function of the turnover at the exchange(s). The primary objective of a clearing corporation is to ensure orderly settlement of trades and to safeguard the security and stability of the settlement system. Keeping in mind the pivotal role of clearing corporations in settling the trades and risk management of the stock markets, it would be detrimental to place the commercial objectives of the shareholders of the clearing corporation in the forefront. Therefore, while private participation is permitted for stock exchanges, it is felt that clearing corporations being at the core of the settlement system must continue to be promoted by stock exchange(s), whose interest would also be to ensure orderly clearing and settlement of trades executed on their platforms. Moreover, the processes of trade matching, margining, clearing and settlement are so interlinked with each other that separating the entities may lead to an increase in legal and operational risks.44Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaOne view that has been held by some experts in this field is that stock exchanges and clearing corporations should be completely separated. This view would entail that stock exchanges thereafter should be freed without any restrictions on their ownership. It has also been argued in this context that the surveillance functions of SEBI as the regulator should be strengthened further instead of the regulator having to depend on the surveillance mechanisms of the stock exchange. The Committee noticed a few difficulties with these arguments. It has to be first recognised that on a value chain consideration, from the trading transaction to clearing and all the way to settlement of the trades, the most risky element (and therefore, the highest in value as a proportion of the total transaction costs) would have to be attached to the clearing and settlement function. Shorn of the clearing and settlement function, the stock exchange is merely a provider of an electronic trading platform. Hence, the first difficulty that the Committee sees in this arrangement is that clearing corporations being at the core of the clearing and settlement function of the exchange, such a separation between the stock exchange and clearing corporation would simply shift the debate of ownership and governance to the level of clearing corporations, without achieving commensurate benefits to the marketplace. Secondly, divesting the stock exchanges of their surveillance function and treating them on the same level as any other financial intermediary, would mean that the market loses the benefit of a second layer of surveillance. Thirdly, entrusting the stock exchanges with a surveillance (regulatory) function means that surveillance begins right at the interface between the client (through the broker) and the trading and settlement system  clearly a sounder basis for a well-regulated marketplace. Finally, when any regulatory role is attached to a profit making public utility like the stock exchange, despite the conflicts of interests we have referred to herein, it confers a certain status to it as a defender of the market thereby making the market more secure for the investor. Hence, the Committee is not in favor of a complete separation of the clearing corporation45Securities and Exchange Board of Indiafrom the stock exchange. The Committee favours a situation where stock exchanges have a significant relationship with the clearing corporation as anchor investors.The Committee therefore, recommends that at least 51% of the paid-up equity capital of the clearing corporation should be held by one or more recognised stock exchanges.2.4 DEPOSITORIES: In the case of depositories, the concept of anchor investors has already been adopted. Such investor(s) are called as sponsors in the context of depositories. Sponsor, as per the SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996, means any person or persons who, acting alone or in combination with another proposes to establish a depository and undertakes to perform the obligations of a sponsor under these regulations.Presently, sponsors belonging to any of the following categories, are required to hold at least 51% of the equity share capital in the depository, either alone or together:-(i)\tA public financial institution as defined in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956);(ii)\ta bank included for the time being in the Second Schedule to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934);(iii)\ta foreign bank operating in India with the approval of the Reserve Bank of India;(iv)\ta recognised stock exchange within the meaning of clause (j) of section 2 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956);(v)\ta body corporate engaged in providing financial services where not less than seventy-five per cent of the equity capital is held by any of46Securities and Exchange Board of Indiathe institutions mentioned in sub-clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) jointly or severally;(vi)\ta body corporate constituted or recognised under any law for the time being in force in a foreign country for providing custodial, clearing or settlement services in the securities market and approved by the Central Government;(vii)\tan institution engaged in providing financial services established outside India and approved by the Central Government; or(viii)\tthe applicant is a fit and proper person.Besides sponsors, no person whether resident in India or not, including depository participants, are allowed to hold more than 5% of the equity share capital in the depositories.The higher shareholding (of at least 51%) by sponsors, including stock exchanges in depositories was permitted in the initial stages for facilitating the setting up of depositories. Therefore, currently, when two depositories have successfully established themselves, it is felt that the independence of depositories has to be ensured by reducing the holding of stock exchanges in depositories. Moreover, depositories in India perform only record keeping activity, unlike some Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) abroad that undertake both settlement and electronic record keeping of securities. The activities performed by depositories in India are therefore, not entwined with the stock exchange (unlike that of clearing corporations). Most importantly, the Committee recognises that stock exchanges and depositories both have a surveillance and regulatory function. Each, in its own way serves as a surveillance layer in the market. The Committee has been apprised of the fact that SEBI as the market regulator often uses records of depositories for its surveillance function, independent of the data47Securities and Exchange Board of Indiacollected from stock exchanges. For obvious reasons, one surveillance mechanism desirably should not be in control of another surveillance mechanism. While, in the context of just two depositories and three or four exchanges in India, this problem may not appear grave in line. However, the Committee is of the opinion that the integrity of the surveillance mechanism in each entity should be maintained and in the process insulate the market from systemic risks to the extent possible. The Committee therefore, feels that a stock exchange should not be allowed to take a position of control in a depository. It is recommended that the holding of stock exchanges in depositories may be restricted to a maximum of 24%.Further, the sponsors shall be subject to a fit and proper approval from SEBI in the manner similar to the shareholders of stock exchanges holding more than 5%.2.5 FOREIGN PARTICIPATION: At present, the combined holding of all persons residing outside India in the equity share capital of an MII is capped at 49% subject to the following:^\tThe combined holding through FDI and FII routes are capped at 26% and 23%, respectively.^\tFIIs can acquire the equity shares of an MII only through the secondary market.^\tAn FII cannot have representation on the board of an MII.^\tNo person outside India, either individually or with persons acting in concert with him can hold more than 5% of the equity share capital of an MII.The Government has clarified that with respect to exchanges that are not listed, FII purchase of shares of such exchanges can only be through transactions48Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaoutside of the exchange provided it is not an initial allotment and that however, if the exchange is listed, transactions by FIIs should be done on the exchange alone. Therefore, technically, it would follow that an FII cannot be a part of the group that applies for a new exchange but immediately after SEBI approves the exchange, the FII can take ownership up to 5% through a direct purchase from any one of the promoters of the exchange. It is felt that there is no ostensible justification for retaining this distinction. It may also be noted that all MIIs are at present unlisted and the question of FIIs purchasing shares of stock exchanges through a stock exchange transaction does not arise.Therefore, it is recommended that in the case of all MIIs, an FII should be allowed to acquire the shares through off market transactions including through initial allotment, as allowed for other shareholder, subject to the limits specified by the Government from time to time. The same may be suggested to the Government by SEBI.2.6 ALL EXPOSURES TO BE COUNTED: The shareholding limits described above shall be inclusive of all exposures (both on and off the balance sheet) of the shareholder to the MII. The Committee feels that it would be counter intuitive to prescribe shareholding limits and allow participation of a shareholder through other means as a creditor or holder ofother instruments issued by the MII.\tIn other words, the maximumpermissible limit will be computed based on the equity share capital of the MII and in case the entity (along with persons acting in concert) has any other direct or indirect exposure in the MII, such exposure in value terms shall be included while determining the total exposure of the shareholder to the MII. This would help maintain a transparent and cleaner separation of ownership and governance  an essential consideration for avoiding conflicts of interests referred to above.49Securities and Exchange Board of India2.7\tTIME FOR COMPLIANCE: New stock exchanges must comply with theownership restrictions ab initio. Similarly, the ownership restrictions for clearing corporations are in line with market practice, therefore, they must comply with the same ab initio. In case of existing depositories, stock exchanges may be given a time limit of 3 years for reducing their holding in depositories to 24%.50Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaChapter IIIGovernance normsAn institutions board of directors plays a central role in its governance. In the case of MIIs, the board decides on important aspects such as:1.\tInvestments in critical functions such as surveillance, risk management, up-gradation of systems for exchange/depository operations, testing of disaster recovery sites, etc2.\tNomination/ selection of Public Interest Directors/Independent directors3.\tSome of the directors may be part of the selection committee that selects key personnel, including the ED of the Exchange/Depository.4.\tTightening of norms such as imposition and collection of margins, member/ depository participant compliance, and resolution of investor grievances, which may lead to deployment of more resources by the member/ depository participant.5.\tSurveillance matters such as shifting of scrips from Trade for Trade to Normal Segment, relaxation of filters, etc6. Financial matters such as security deposit collected from members/depository participants, charges levied upon members/depository participants, investments and deployment of surplus funds in property/building/ land.7.\tMatters pertaining to inspection, selection of members/ depository participants for the same.8.\tInvestor related issues such as increasing arbitration centers, increasing manpower for redressal of investor grievances, etc51Securities and Exchange Board of India9.\tPenalty structure, collection of penalty etc10. Appointment/ composition of various executive committees, statutory committees, including the arbitration panel11.\tAmending rules/byelaws/regulations of the MIIBy being on the board of an MII, the directors can potentially influence the decisions of the board and in extreme circumstances may even prevent the MII from fulfilling the primary objectives for which it was created.3.1. BOARD COMPOSITION FOR STOCK EXCHANGES: Pursuant to corporatisation and demutualisation, SEBI, has prescribed that in the case of stock exchanges, not more than 25% of the board can be composed of trading member directors, a minimum of 25% is to be comprised of public interest directors and balance should consist of shareholder directors.Trading members on the board of a stock exchange are privy to confidential information. This therefore can give rise to conflict of interest when the entity regulated by the stock exchange is also on the board of the stock exchange. Conflict of interest also arises when shareholders with commercial motives form a majority in an entity which also has regulatory functions to perform.Moreover, in institutions which are subject to dispersed shareholding requirements or where the shareholders consist of mainly public sector financial institutions, the board may end up being a little more than a rubber stamp for managements decisions.Internationally, the appointment of independent directors (previously public interest directors)23 to the board of a market infrastructure institutions SRO is52Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaundertaken typically to ensure that the board responds to inherent conflicts that is a consequence of the entity pursuing both private and public interests simultaneously. In order to effect this, such directors need to be independent both of the market infrastructure institution on whose board they sit and also of other relevant parties, including participants using the facilities of the market infrastructure institution and issuers listed or whose stock is traded on the exchange.24 More number of PIDs on the Board of the exchange would enable the PIDs to have a stronger voice in the governance of exchanges.It is therefore, recommended that no trading /clearing member (irrespective of exchange where he operates) shall be allowed on the board of any of the stock exchange and the number of public interest directors on the board of a stock exchange shall at least be equal to the number of shareholder directors without trading/ clearing interest. The appointment of the Chairperson of the Board shall be with prior approval of SEBI. Terms and conditions of appointment of Chairperson should be subject to SEBIs approval. The sitting fees payable to the PIDs shall be as per the Companies Act, 1956. They shall not be paid any commission or any other remuneration.The committee feels that trading members bring rich practical experience and the same should be utilized in a manner which doesnt conflict with governance. Therefore in order to utilize the experience and expertise of trading members in the securities market, an advisory committee shall be constituted by the board of the stock exchange, comprising of trading members. Trading members shall not be permitted participation in any other committee of the exchange. The advisory committee to the board may deal with non-regulatory, operational matters such as product design, technology, etc. The board of the exchange shall consult the advisory committee on these issues. The Chairman of the board shall head the advisory committee. The53Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaadvisory committee shall meet a minimum of 4 times a year. The recommendations of the advisory committee shall necessarily be placed before the ensuing meeting of the board of the exchange and shall be disclosed on exchanges website.3.2. BOARD COMPOSITION FOR CLEARING CORPORATIONS: The existing board structure at NSCCL, ICCL and MCX-SXCCL are as follows:-NSCCL\tICCL\tMCX-SX CCLChairman  1 MD/CEO  1 Other non executive directors  5\tMD/CEO - 2 Independent directors  2\tShareholder directors - 3 Independent directors - 3 Executive director - 1BSE\texecutiveofficers  3As of now, there is no directive for board composition of clearing corporations. It may be because few outside experts are available given the complex nature of activities performed by clearing corporations. As G30 recommends, clearing and settlement institutions may seek to appoint senior managers from their users who have proven managerial experience, wide industry expertise, an ability to assess complex situations and make key strategic decisions. 25In order to utilise the expertise of clearing members, it is recommended that the model adopted for stock exchanges may be extended to clearing corporations as well. It is therefore recommended that the number of public interest directors on the board of a clearing corporation shall at least be equal to the number of shareholder directors without trading/clearing interest. Further, an advisory committee shall be constituted by the board of the clearing corporation, comprising mainly of clearing members. Clearing members shall not be54Securities and Exchange Board of Indiapermitted participation in any other committee of the clearing corporation. The advisory committee to the board shall deal with non-regulatory, operational matters such as procedure related to clearing and settlement, technology, etc. The board of the clearing corporation shall consult the advisory committee on these issues. The Chairman of the board shall head the advisory committee. The advisory committee shall meet a minimum of 4 times a year. The recommendations of the advisory committee shall be placed before the ensuing meeting of the board of the clearing corporation and shall be disclosed on clearing corporations website.3.3. BOARD COMPOSITION FOR DEPOSITORIES: The existing board structure at NSDL and CDSL are as follows:-NSDL\tCDSLIndependent Directors  5 Shareholder directors  5 MD/CEO  1\tIndependent directors  2Shareholder directors  5Whole-time directors  1Both internationally and in India, the board structure for depositories is not subject to stringent norms as compared to those of stock exchanges. It has been felt that the conflicts of interests faced by depositories are not same as those faced by stock exchanges. Moreover, only financial institutions/banks/stock exchanges, etc. can be sponsors of a depository and these are mostly nominated as shareholder directors.However, in order to ensure that depositories are also subjected to sound corporate governance norms, it is recommended that the board composition in depositories should be the same as prescribed for listed companies under clause 49 of the listing agreement.55Securities and Exchange Board of India3.4. DISCLOSURES BY BOARD MEMBERS: All transactions in securities of the board members of the MII and their family have to be disclosed to the board of the MII.3.5. EMPLOYEE(S) ON THE BOARD OF THE MII: The MD/CEO of the MII shall be ex-officio member on the board of the MII. The MD/CEO shall not be included in either the category of public interest directors or shareholder directors. In case the MII wishes to appoint any other official on its Board in addition to the MD/CEO, the same shall be subject to the approval of shareholders and SEBI, in that order. The additional official shall be counted in the category of shareholder directors.3.6. TIME FOR COMPLIANCE: All MIIs may be given time until the next AGM for implementing the recommendations on board composition. In case the next AGM falls within three months, the recommendations shall be implemented before the subsequent AGM.56Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaChapter IVMeasures for conflicts resolutionSEBI has so far restricted the trading member representation on the board of stock exchanges and has prescribed the minimum number of public interest directors on the board as a means of reducing the conflicts of interests in the governance of stock exchanges. These governance arrangements are intended to ensure that decisions taken by the board have the benefit of unbiased advice and to prevent the concentration of decision-making power in a few hands. However, it must also be realized that conflicts of interests may also permeate to the lower levels of hierarchy in an MII, which may impair the regulatory efficiency of the organization.Internationally, as a best practice, stock exchanges have chosen to segregate the regulatory functions from their commercial functions and have put in place measures to ensure autonomy to the regulatory departments. The degree of separation ranges from outsourcing the regulatory function to an independent SRO, hiving off those departments to a separate subsidiary and putting in place measures such as Chinese walls between the commercial and regulatory departments.Ideally, from a regulatory perspective, it is felt that it is important to have complete segregation of commercial activities from the regulatory activities. However, it is not an easy task to identify cases where commercial and regulatory functions are joined or overlapping. Especially in the case of conflicts that arise due to competition, the commercial activities are sometimes so commingled with the regulatory function that they are difficult to separate into watertight compartments. For instance, the competitor may not register himself57Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaas a member of the exchange; instead, the competitor may even be a technical provider, in which case such measures may fail.The following measures are therefore, suggested as means to address some of the conflicts arising from commercial and regulatory activities of an MII:4.1. MECHANISM TO ENSURE AUTONOMY OF REGULATORY DEPARTMENTS: In order to ensure that regulatory functions are carried out satisfactorily, it is recommended that;The senior executives heading risk management, surveillance, listing, registration, compliance, inspection, enforcement, arbitration, default, etc. shall report directly to an independent committee of the board consisting of a majority of public interest directors and also to the MD/CEO (dual reporting).The remuneration of such executives, including the annual increment indexed for inflation, should be a fixed sum without any variable component linked to the commercial performance of the MII. Further, the compensation should not include any form of equity / equity linked or stock options in the MII. It should also be ensured that the remuneration is determined after giving due regard to the average levels of compensation given to employees in similar rank. The remuneration package will be subject to review of the remuneration committee/management compensation committee.The initial appointment of the above employees shall be for a fixed tenure, as may be decided by the independent committee. In case any action against such senior executives is taken, it should be subject to appeal to the independent committee, up to two years after being relieved from such department.58Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaChinese walls in terms of work area, infrastructure, personnel etc, shall be maintained between the regulatory and commercial departments. The definition and details regarding Chinese walls shall be as per SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992. The MII should have an internal manual covering the management of conflicts for both commercial and regulatory functions of the MII, supported by comprehensive training and awareness. Further, the entire conflict management framework should periodically be reviewed and be strengthened based on the observations of such review.4.2. APPOINTMENT OF MD/CEO: At present, the appointment of MD/CEO of a stock exchange is subject to approval by SEBI; however, the terms and conditions, including remuneration of such MD/CEO are decided by the board of the stock exchange. No such requirements have been prescribed for depositories. The present procedure for appointment of MD/CEO of a stock exchange shall continue and the same shall be extended to the MD/CEO of clearing corporations and depositories. SEBI shall ensure that the CEO is appointed for a reasonable tenure, say between 3-5 years.4.3. COMPENSATION OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL: The compensation of key management personnel, including the MD/CEO/ED and others as may be identified by the board, should be decided by a remuneration committee/management compensation committee appointed by the board. It should also be ensured that the remuneration is determined after giving due regard to the industry standards for the same. The remuneration of such executives, including the annual increment indexed for inflation, should be a fixed sum without any variable component linked to the commercial performance of the MII. Further, the compensation should not include any form of equity / equity linked or stock options in the MII.59Securities and Exchange Board of India4.4. APPOINTMENT OF COMPLIANCE OFFICER: The Committee noted that SEBI has mandated various registered intermediaries to appoint a compliance officer to ensure that the intermediary complies with the rules, regulations, circulars and directives of SEBI. Similar requirements have also been mandated for depositories.It is recommended that appointment of compliance officer shall be mandatory for stock exchanges and clearing corporations. The compliance officer shall be responsible for monitoring the compliance of the Act, rules and regulations, notifications, guidelines, instructions etc. issued by SEBI or the Central Government and for redressal of investor's grievances. The compliance officer shall immediately and independently report to SEBI any instance of noncompliance observed.60Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaChapter V Other issues5.1. LISTING: Listing of an MII brings with it advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, listing of an MII provides an exit route to its shareholders, bringing transparency and better governance to the functioning of the MII. However, on the other hand, listing may also usher in more conflict of interests for the stock exchange, since monitoring its own listing related compliances or that of a related/competing MII will be an issue.On balance, shareholders of an MII need to be long-term investors who are sufficiently motivated to take a keen interest in the functioning of the MII and to contribute to its growth by providing the necessary value addition in terms of technology, market/product design, managerial inputs, etc. An MII should not become a vehicle for attracting speculative investments. Further, MIIs being public institutions, any downward movement in its share prices may lead to a loss of credibility and this may be detrimental to the market as a whole. Therefore, the Committee is not in favor of permitting listing of MIIs. However, the disclosures and corporate governance requirements of the listing agreement applicable to listed companies shall be made applicable to MIIs too. The information required to be disclosed shall be posted on the website of the MII.Further, if there is an entity, which chooses to get itself listed on a stock exchange and is substantially owned (i.e. 24% or more of equity capital) by that stock exchange or by an MII in which that stock exchange holds shares, then such entity shall seek prior approval from SEBI before listing.61Securities and Exchange Board of India5.2. NET WORTH REQUIREMENTS: MIIs by their very nature necessitate huge, long-term, sunk investments. Hence, net worth is one of the important eligibility criteria for setting up an MII. It is required for meeting the initial capital required towards infrastructure and ensures that only serious players enter this arena.SEBI has already prescribed a net worth requirement of ` 100 crores for depositories. Further, SEBI Board in its meeting held on December 22, 2009, stipulated a net worth requirement of ` 100 crores for setting up a new stock exchange, while a net worth requirement of ` 100 crores is being contemplated for clearing corporations. The committee deliberated and recommended the following:5.2.1.\tStock Exchanges: Stock exchanges shall be required to have a net worth of ` 100 crores at all times. From the date of notification of the net worth requirement, exchanges not meeting the said net worth requirement, i.e., exchanges not having nationwide trading terminals / as may be decided by SEBI may be given a period of 10 years to comply with the same. While computing the net worth, investments in MIIs can be included, whereas, all other non-core investments in related, unrelated/other business shall be excluded.5.2.2.\tDepositories: The present net worth requirement of ` 100 crores for depositories may be retained. However, all other investments in related, unrelated/other business shall be excluded while computing the net worth.5.2.3.\tClearing Corporations: A Clearing Corporation provides clearing and settlement to the trades executed on a stock exchange by becoming the counter party for every buy and sell transaction. It provides novation and guarantees the settlement of every trade. While in the equity segment, the guarantee extends62Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaonly for a few days over the settlement period, in the derivatives segment, it extends for months and even years (as in the case of long term options).In the event of a major default, if the clearing corporation is unable to meet its obligations, it could even lead to a systemic collapse of the financial market. Keeping in view the clearing and settlement function, a need is felt to prescribe a higher net worth requirement for clearing corporations, as compared to stock exchanges and depositories. The Committee is of the view that net worth requirement of ? 100 crores for a clearing corporation is inadequate. It is recommended that the net worth requirement for a Clearing Corporation may be fixed at ? 300 crores. The clearing corporation shall meet relevant networth criteria on an ongoing basis.It is also suggested that while initially a clearing corporation may be permitted to be set up with a net worth of ? 100 crores, they may be required to increase it to ? 300 crores within a period of 3 years (or any other time limit as may be prescribed by SEBI). Further, in order that such a net worth is available, in a worst case scenario, it is suggested that it may be maintained in the form of liquid assets at all times. Liquid assets would be those assets that are permitted to be deposited by a stockbroker in a stock exchange (clearing corporation) towards margin obligations. Until such time the clearing corporation achieves the prescribed net worth, it shall not be permitted to pay any dividend to its shareholders.5.3. MIIs TO GENERATE ONLY REASONABLE PROFITS: The MII being a public utility should endeavor to earn only reasonable profits at par with average earnings of the corporate sector in India. Therefore, it is recommended that a cap may be fixed on the maximum return that can be earned by MII on its net worth and can be distributed / allocated to the shareholders of MII out of the total63Securities and Exchange Board of Indiareturns earned by MII. Any return/profits above such maximum attributable amount would be transferred to IPF or SGF as the case may be and the same would not form part of shareholders funds/ net worth for the purposes of determining returns and book value of the shares. This would strengthen the MII to withstand shocks, make them robust and may lead to reduction of the charges levied by MIIs on the users. The cap may be fixed by SEBI after taking into consideration risk free return based on the yield on a 10 year GOI bond and a risk premium to account for the risks faced by MIIs including equity risk premium and liquidity risk due to non listing of MIIs. It should also take into account differential tax rate applicable to unlisted entities as the Committee has recommended that the MIIs should not be permitted to list.It is therefore, recommended that maximum profit available for distribution / allocation to shareholders which can be utilized for payment of dividends and for appropriation to general reserves, balances of profit & loss account should be capped at a certain percentage of annual return on net worth of the previous year. This cap will be determined by SEBI based on factors enumerated above. Net worth for this purpose would mean paid-up capital, balance of general reserves, profit & loss account and share premium account. The MII will be free to pay dividend to shareholders out of profit earned or out of free reserves/balance of profit and loss account and share premium account in accordance with Companys act 1956. Any profit earned over and above the prescribed return on net worth shall be transferred to IPF or SGF as the case may be and shall not be available for distribution to shareholders nor will it become part of shareholders funds. The ceiling on rate of return in all cases will be on profits after providing for taxes. The rate of return may be reset by SEBI considering the change in risk free rate of return, inflation etc.64Securities and Exchange Board of India5.4.\tRELATED BUSINESS OF MIIs: The SEBI (Depositories andParticipants) Regulations, 1996, provides that;the depository shall not carry on any activity other than that of a depository unless the activity is incidental to the activity of the depository:provided that a depository may carry out such activity not incidental to its activities as a depository, as may be assigned to the depository, by the Central Government or by a regulator in the financial sector, through the establishment of Strategic Business Unit(s) specific to each activity with the prior approval of the Board and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the Board, including transfer of such activity to a separate company within such time as may be specified by the Board, having regard to the matters which are relevant to the efficient and orderly function of the depository as mentioned in regulation 13.Explanation  For the purposes of this clause, a strategic Business Unit shall be an organizational unit of a company with its own mission, objectives and business strategy that is given the responsibility to serve the particular demands of one business area with appropriate technological, financial and other segregations.It is felt that the risks of taking up activities that are not incidental or those that are unrelated to the activities of the MII must be segregated to a separate legal entity or as may be permitted by SEBI. Such restrictions shall be made applicable to all MIIs.Further, when a related business of an MII delivers a service to another MII, it should be ensured that there is equal, unrestricted, transparent and fair access to all without any bias towards its affiliated entity. SEBI should step in to investigate complaints in this regard and fasten liability on the MII who owns the related business. SEBI should even go as far as prohibiting an MII from using services supplied by its related business, should it detect any discriminatory practices. Further, all commercial arrangements such as listing65Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaof international indices, etc. which provide for exclusive rights should be subject to prior approval of SEBI. SEBI may grant its approval for such exclusivity for a limited period on a case-to-case basis, after examining the proposal.5.5. REPLACEMENT OF SCR(MIMPS) REGULATIONS: The MIMPS Regulations were notified at the time of corporatisation and demutualisation and Regulation 3 of the MIMPS Regulations reads as under:-These Regulations shall be applicable to all recognised stock exchanges in respect of which the scheme of corporatisation and demutualisation has been approved by the Board under section 4B of the Act.In order to make the chapters on ownership norms applicable to other Stock Exchange, SEBI has issued separate notifications to those stock exchanges (NSE and OTCEI) which did not undergo a process of corporatisation and demutualisation. Further, for new stock exchanges, SEBI has adopted the practice of imposing the compliance with MIMPS Regulations as a condition while granting recognition.Moreover, the MIMPS Regulations were framed with the objective of increasing the public shareholding in the stock exchanges. With all the exchanges having increased their public holding to meet the prescribed limit, the Committee feels that the MIMPS Regulations have served their purpose. It is therefore, recommended that a new regulations may replace the MIMPS Regulations for regulating Ownership and Governance Regulations for Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations and consequent amendments (as required) may also be carried out. The concept of persons acting in concert also needs to be separately defined in the new Regulations for the purpose of ownership norms. The66Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaexisting Regulations for depositories may continue and be suitably amended to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee.5.6. EXIT NORMS: The exit norms for stock exchanges have already been prescribed by SEBI; it may be examined by SEBI in light or recommendation of this report whether these norms needs to be reviewed. Exit norms may also be prescribed for clearing corporations and depositories to provide for orderly exit of these important institutions.5.7. POWERS TO SEBI IN MATTERS RELATING TO MIIs: The Committee noted that SEBI has powers to regulate the MIIs. However, it felt that powers of SEBI needs to be further augmented since it has to discharge the responsibility of regulating MIIs by way of direct supervision and monitoring of their activities. The Committee reviewed Section 3(1) of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, which reads as under:Any stock exchange, which is desirous of being recognised for the purposes of this Act, may make an application in the prescribed manner to the Central Government.The Committee was of the view that SEBI must be invested with more powers for accepting/rejecting applications for recognition of stock exchanges. The Committee therefore, recommends that the above provision may be rephrased explicitly to the effect that unless and until SEBI grants recognition, an entity cannot call itself a stock exchange. SEBI should have the discretion to limit the number of MIIs operating in the market, in the interest of the market and in public interest. It is pertinent to note that this would be similar to the treatment afforded by the Reserve Bank with respect to new banks.67Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaFurther, the SC(R)R prescribes the procedure for seeking recognition, period for recognition, form of application for recognition, etc. for stock exchanges. The Committee is of the view that detailed requirements for clearing corporations should be prescribed by SEBI under its own regulations, so that it is in a position to regulate effectively and carry out amendments in a timely manner to keep pace with the needs of the market. SEBI may undertake this exercise and take it up with the Ministry of Finance. A similar exercise may be undertaken with regard to stock exchanges as well.5.8\tREVIEW AFTER FIVE YEARS: Finally, the Committee recommends thatthe working of the MII should be reviewed again by SEBI after five years, once the suggestion made by this committee is implemented. The stock market is evolving and a review may be inevitable in the light of the new technological developments, introduction of new products, growth of financial markets, trade and capital flows and global integration.In light of the above, it would be desirable to keep a close watch on the working of the MII so that the gains from well-tuned markets result in the growth of the real economy and maintenance of financial stability.68Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaAnnexure ASample QuestionnairePart A(Applicable to all three categories of MIIs)Functions1.

SEBI broadly prescribes the Board composition in the case of stock exchanges. Currently there is a restriction on the extent of representation by trading members on the Board (maximum 25%). The PIDs (minimum 25%) are empanelled by SEBI. The balance are shareholder directors.73Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaa.

      "1/43/4 11/4  1/23/4  Securities and Exchange Board of IndiaDiscussion Paper on \"Monitoring Agency Report and RelatedDisclosures\"1. Backgrounda. SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (ICDR Regulations) requires that the offer document shall contain the disclosures about the Objects of the Issue. This requirement ensures that the amount to be utilized towards each object of the issue is specifically earmarked and disclosed in the offer document. Mandating such detailed disclosures helps in monitoring of utilization of the funds raised through public issues as well as enables the investors to take informed decision. Keeping similar objective in mind, SEBI has recently amended the ICDR Regulations and put a limit on the amount that can be earmarked for General Corporate Purpose to 25% of the total issue size. Further, ICDR Regulations also requires appointment of Monitoring Agency if the issue size exceeds Rs. 500 Cr. for monitoring of utilization of issue proceeds.2. Current Regulatory Frameworka. Regulation 16 of the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 as amended till date provides as under:\"16. (1) If the issue size exceeds five hundred crore rupees, the issuer shall make arrangements for the use of proceeds of the issue to be monitored by a public financial institution or by one of the scheduled commercial banks named in the offer document as bankers of the issuer:Provided that nothing contained in this clause shall apply to an offer for sale or an issue of specified securities made by a bank or public financial institution or an insurance company.16. (2) The monitoring agency shall submit its report to the issuer in the format specified in Schedule IX on a half yearly basis, till the proceeds of the issue have been fully utilised.\"b. Provisions in the Listing Agreement:i.\tClause 41(4)(e) of the Listing Agreement provides as under:If the company had not commenced commercial production or commercial operations during the reportable period, the company shall, instead of submitting financial results, disclose the details of amount raised, the portions thereof which is utilized and thatPage 1 of 10remaining unutilized, the details of investment made pending utilisation, brief description of the project which is pending completion, status of the project and expected date of commencement of commercial production or commercial operations.ii.\tClause 43A of the Listing Agreement provides as under:(1) The company agrees to furnish to the stock exchange on a quarterly basis, a statement indicating material deviations, if any, in the use of proceeds of a public or rights issue from the objects stated in the offer document.(2) Where the company has appointed a monitoring agency to monitor utilization of proceeds of a public or rights issue and such monitoring agency has pointed out any deviation in the use of the proceeds of the issue from the objects stated in the offer document or has given any other reservations about the end use of funds, the company agrees to intimate the same to the stock exchange, without any delay.iii.\tWhile laying down the role of Audit Committee, Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement, requires Audit Committee to mandatorily review the following:/\tthe statement of uses / application of funds raised through an issue/\tthe statement of funds utilized for purposes other than those stated in the offer document/prospectus/notice/\tReport submitted by the Monitoring AgencyThe Audit Committee is also required to make appropriate recommendations to the Board for taking necessary steps on the above-mentioned matters. Further, on an annual basis, the company shall prepare a statement of funds utilized for purposes other than those stated in the offer document/prospectus/notice and place it before the Audit Committee. This statement shall be certified by the statutory auditors of the company.c. The Companies (Auditors Report) Order, 2003 (CARO) in Para 4(XX) of Matters to be included in the auditors report. requires as under:Whether the management has disclosed on the end use of money raised by public issues and the same has been verifiedPage 2 of 10d. Revised Schedule VI to the Companies Act, 1956 as amended till date and Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 requires that in case of an issue of securities made for a specific purpose and the whole or part of the amount raised has not been used for that purpose till the balance sheet date, the financial statements shall contain a disclosure on how such unutilized amounts have been used or invested by way of note to the financial statements.e. Section 13(8)(ii) of Companies Act, 2013 requires that the company shall not change its objects for which it raised the money through prospectus unless a special resolution is passed by the company and dissenting shareholders have been given opportunity for exit by the promoters and shareholders having control in accordance with regulations to be specified by the Securities and Exchange Board.3. Major Changes ProposedThe key changes proposed in Monitoring Agency Report and Related Disclosures are as under:3.1. Appointment of Monitoring AgencyPresent requirementAppointment of Monitoring Agency is compulsory for all issues where issue size exceeds Rupees five hundred croresProposed requirementMandatory appointment of monitoring agency for all issues, irrespective of issue size.RationaleAs detailed in para (2)(e) above, the Companies Act, 2013 has included certain provisions for deviation in utilization of issue proceeds. Accordingly, it is pertinent to extend the requirement of monitoring of utilization of issue proceeds to all the companies to ensure that such instances are identified and addressed in accordance with extant legal framework. It will also strengthen the monitoring of utilization of all the equity capital raised through issuance of equity shares to public.3.2. Frequency of Submission of Monitoring Agency Report Present requirementMonitoring Agency is required to submit its report to the issuer half-yearly. Proposed requirementMandatory submission of report by the monitoring agency on quarterly basis till the funds are fully utilized.Page 3 of 10RationaleAs per Clause 41 & 43 of the Listing Agreement, the company is required to quarterly disclose details of fund utilization and variations in such utilization. For meeting such disclosure requirement, the company either obtains the information from monitoring agency or collates the information itself. Thus, there appears to be a need for quarterly submission of monitoring agency report. The said suggestion was also discussed in Primary Market Advisory Committee (PMAC) meeting held on November 17, 2011 and the committee agreed with the suggestion of aligning reporting requirements to quarterly basis.3.3. Dissemination of Monitoring Agency ReportPresent requirementNo Requirement (only material deviations are required to be disclosed by the issuer company under clause 43A(i) of Listing Agreement)Proposed requirementMandatory submission of Monitoring Agency Report to Stock Exchanges for public dissemination.RationaleAt present, the report submitted by the monitoring agency to the issuer is not required to be made public. Considering that Companies Act, 2013 requires prior approval from shareholders for any change of object and a provision for exit to dissenting shareholders, it is very important that the shareholders get regular update on utilization of issue proceeds. Disclosure of report of monitoring agency in public domain will serve the above objects.Thus, in order to bring more transparency in the disclosures, it is proposed to mandate submission of Monitoring Agency Report to Stock Exchanges for public dissemination.3.4. Categorization of ReportsPresent requirementNo specific requirement for categorizing the report in case of deviation of funds from the stated objects of the issue in the offer document.Proposed requirementThe monitoring agency to grade the deviation on the 2-digit scale as under:First digit indicates deviation from the objects stated in offer document as under:Page 4 of 100  No deviation from the objects stated in offer document1  Utilization different from Objects stated in OD but in line with change of objects approved by shareholders' resolution2  Utilization neither in line with Objects stated in OD nor approved by shareholders' resolutionSecond digit indicates range of deviation from the specified objects asunder:0  upto 10% deviation1  10 - 25%2  25-50%3  50-75%4  75-100%5  Not ascertainableThus, code of 12 would indicate that the utilization of issue proceeds is different from Objects stated in OD but is in line with change of objects approved by shareholders' resolution and the deviation in utilization is in the range of 25%-50%.The deviation in utilization of issue proceeds for the stated objects could occur due to delay in the stated time schedule, changing the fund allocations within the stated objects in the offer document or diversion of funds to the object other than stated in the offer document. All these deviations reported by the monitoring agency shall clearly indicate the same along with the reasons for such deviation and also indicate whether necessary approvals from Board/ Shareholders have been obtained. The Stock exchanges shall prominently disseminate list of monitoring agency reports in separate lists based on first digit of said categorization.RationaleMonitoring Agency Reports where there is a deviation from objects of the issue should be segregated from reports where the utilization is in line with objects of the issue.Section 13(8)(ii) of Companies Act, 2013 requires that the company shall not change its objects for which it raised the money through prospectus unless a special resolution is passed by the company and dissenting shareholders have been given opportunity for exit by the promoters and shareholders having control. The companies whose reports have first digit of code as 2 can be indicative of the possible deviation in utilization/ change of objects.3.5. Comments of Audit Committee and Management on the findings of Monitoring AgencyPresent requirementNo such requirement exists.Page 5 of 10Proposed requirementAudit Committee and the Board/ Management shall provide their comments for the deviation, if any, pointed out in the report of monitoring agency.RationaleIt is desirable to have comments of management/ audit committee which will help understand the reasons for such deviation, if any.3.6. Timelines for submission of report to the stock exchanges. Present requirementNo specific timeframe has been provided in the existing framework. Proposed requirementFor effective monitoring and timely disclosure, it is desirable to have a fixed time limit for submission of the report. It is proposed that the issuer company shall ensure that the Monitoring Agency Report is submitted within 45 days from the end of the quarter to the stock exchangesRationaleIt is desirable to have timely information of the status of utilization of issue proceeds & the deviation, if any. Such disclosure will help shareholder/ stakeholder/ investor in taking informed decision.3.7. Sub-committee of Board members to oversee the monitoring of utilization of issue proceedsPresent requirementNo such specific requirement for overseeing the monitoring of utilization of issue proceeds.Proposed requirementA committee of Board of Directors of the Company to be constituted to oversee the monitoring of utilization of issue proceeds is constituted before opening of the issue. The said committee shall facilitate monitoring of issue proceeds by monitoring agency. The majority of the member of the said committee shall be independent directors and the same shall be headed by an independent director.RationaleConstitution of such committee will be helpful in facilitating monitoring of utilization of issue proceeds. Further, the said requirement will ensurePage 6 of 10active involvement of Board of Directors monitoring of utilization of issue proceeds.4. Revision in format of Monitoring Agency ReportProposed new format for report of monitoring agency to be submitted to the issuer company is placed at Annexure.Public CommentsIt is proposed to carry out necessary amendments to regulatory framework in line with revised requirements proposed in this discussion paper. Considering the importance of proposed changes for all the stakeholders including the listed companies, public comments on the draft framework are solicited.

As engines of economic growth, they contribute significantly to nation building. They provide longterm and high-risk capital to a wide variety of ventures at all stages of their evolution, creating stability and entrepreneurial capability. This includes risk capital in the form of equity capital for pre-revenue stage companies, early and late stage ventures, growth companies that wish to scale their operations, and even companies facing distress. AIFs help incubate innovative ideas and invest in a broad array of sectors ranging from e-commerce, hospitals, tech ventures, education ventures, and industrial and infrastructure projects. The capability capital also ensures well-run and well-governed businesses. There is unanimity in the recognition that AIFs are a critical part of a robust and lively capital market.In the light of this vital role, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has taken several progressive measures since 1996 to promote Alternative Investment Funds. SEBIs most recent initiative was the enactment of the SEBI Alternative Investment Fund Regulations, 2012 and subsequent amendments. Considering the developing nature of Indias AIF market, considerable advances in regulation are needed to promote the supply of risk capital in a prudent fashion. Accordingly, SEBI established the Alternative Investment Policy Advisory Committee (AIPAC). The Terms of Reference of the Committee are to advise SEBI in the following areas:(i)\tthe further development of the alternative investment and startup ecosystem in India;(ii) the removal of hurdles that might hinder the development of the alternative investment industry;(iii) issues which need to be taken up with other regulators for the development of the alternative investment industry; and(iv) any other issue relevant to the alternative investment industry and development of the start-up eco-system in India.The Committee comprises 21 members. The Committee has met four times since its inception in March, 2015. In its initial phase the Committee decided to focus on four central areas. These include reforms in the fields of taxation, development of domestic capital pools in India, attracting overseas managers onshore in India, and the categorization of Alternative Investment Funds in SEBIs regulatory regime. This first report addresses these four areas, and recommendations are founded on core underlying principles.1As the field of Alternative Investment Funds has a wide canvas, the Committee will meet again to discuss and make recommendations in other areas like the novel instrument of crowd-funding, business development companies and related topicsIt is evident that the Government of India and regulators have embarked on a reform-oriented approach and there is significant momentum. The recommendations in this report are, therefore, timely. I welcome further reviews and comments from other industry players and stakeholders of the AIF industry.I do hope that policymakers will embrace the proposed reforms. To assist policymakers, the precise wordings of suggested amendments and draft notifications have been included in the report.I sincerely thank all those who worked tirelessly and have spared their valuable time from their regular duties to help craft the recommendations and prepare this report. In particular, I wish to thank SEBI and its staff for providing its invaluable guidance and support at various stages of this report.N.R.

They cannot only be financed by traditional sources of debt, such as banks. They need access to sufficient amounts of stable, long-term, risk capital, which are angel capital, venture capital and private equity, collectively referred to as Alternative Investment Funds. Venture capital and angels provide equity capital to new ventures and nurture and mentor the management of portfolio enterprises. As the capital needs of a growing venture rise, it seeks private equity which adds value in several ways, such as improving governance processes, providing access to networks and helping scale the enterprise.1.2\tA distinguishing characteristic of both venture capital and private equity is thatthey add strategic value and enhance the internal proficiencies of enterprises, thus being regarded as invaluable capability capital. The distinction between venture capital and private equity has become blurred as they have become stage agnostic with both forms of capital providing capital to a wide range of enterprises at different stages of their development.1.3 The venture capital and private equity industry has contributed considerably to Indias economic growth. Between 2001 and 2015, venture capital and private equity of more than $103 billion was invested in Indian companies. These investments were made in more than 3,100 companies across 12 major sectors, including those critical for the countrys development. The enterprises have ranged from start-ups to mature, mid-size companies. A significant portion of these investments have been made by global fund managers operating India-focussed offshore funds, global fund managers operating in India and Indian fund managers operating offshore funds, in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI).5Type of deals in 2015*SPLIT BY VOLUME\tSPLIT BY VALUE4.5%\t0.5%\t0.5% 1.5%14.9%I75318,050O Value (S mn) (RHS) Volume (LHS)19,75411,41510,2114,848150010006316965524501.

The digital age has created a fertile new environment for start-ups. The Government also wishes to create the eco-system in which start-ups can mushroom and thrive. Venture capital, private equity and angel capital are vital elements in this eco-system. Accordingly, reforming the AIF regulatory framework for venture capital, private equity and angel capital will play a key role in making a success of the start-up policy.1.5 The risk appetite of this asset class has helped shape several new industries, such as mobile telecommunications, information technology services, social media and ecommerce. Portfolio companies of venture capital and private equity funds have contributed significantly to Indias economic development through outcomes such as :a)\tStronger Job Creation Record: Venture capital and private equity have helped accelerate job growth. In the five years following initial investment, companies backed by private equity grew direct employment faster than companies not backed by private equity.b)\tSuperior Financial Performance: In the two years following initial investment, revenues of portfolio companies grew 28% more than revenues of companies not backed by venture capital and private equity in a comparable period. In addition, their profits were stronger.c)\tGreater Export Earnings: Venture capital and private equity investors focused on building capabilities in their portfolio companies, resulting in increased export earnings. This strategy also helped reduce risks associated with volatility of domestic growth and currency rate changes.d)\tMore Acquisitive and Global Mind-set: In the sample set, 80% of the companies participated in their first cross-border M&A only after receiving venture capital or private equity funding. Venture capital and private equity fund managers shared their experience, knowledge and networks to help companies acquire strategic partners.e)\tSuperior Corporate Governance and Higher Tax Contribution: Portfolio companies of venture capital and private equity funds generally improved their corporate governance. Private companies with revenuesless than INR 7.5 billion linked to VC/PE contributed 18.8% of the corporate tax receipts for companies of a similar size, more than 13.1% of total revenue within this group.71.6 To foster venture capital and private equity as a source of risk capital for entrepreneurs and innovation, the Government of India enacted the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 (VCF Regulations). Later, SEBI introduced a comprehensive legal framework in the form of SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (AIF regulations), repealing and replacing the erstwhile SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996.1.7 Alternative investment funds (AIFs) are defined in Regulation 2(1)(b) of SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012. AIFs refer to privately pooled investment funds, which are not covered by any regulation of SEBI governing fund management, nor come under the direct regulation of other sectoral regulators in India. AIFs have been divided into three categories in the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012. AIFs include venture capital funds, private equity funds, debt funds, infrastructure funds, social venture funds amongst others. AIFs include funds which employ diverse or complex trading strategies in the secondary markets in the securities of listed companies. These latter funds account for less that 10% of the AIF investments made.1.8 Venture capital and private equity funds with fund managers domiciled in India and which were registered with SEBI post 2012, are now classified as AIFs and come within the ambit of the AIF regulations. These funds also include those in which offshore capital has been invested.India: Alternative Investment Funds by Category (As of September 2015)Category\tCommitments\tFunds raised\tInvestments made\tNo. ofraised\t(Rs. crores)\t(Rs crores)\tAIFs(Rs. crores)Category IInfrastructure Fund\t6875.69\t1970.25\t1350.08\t8Social Venture Fund\t600.52\t259.52\t216.65\t3Venture Capital Fund\t1382.39\t798.48\t487.85\t36SME Fund\t135.00\t123.79\t20.03\t8Category I Total\t8993.60\t3152.04\t2074.61\t55Category II\t14375.71\t8079.29\t6792.38\t87Category III\t2162.79\t1568.88\t896.43\t26Grand Total\t25532.10\t12800.21\t9763.42\t16781.9 AIFs with domestic capital have only invested $850 million in the first 3 quarters of 2015. The recent amendments for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in AIFs (most importantly the exemptions from all sectoral FDI caps and conditions for downstream investments by India-sponsored and managed AIFs), is expected to see a dramatic shift in the quantum of investments madeby AIFs, potentially translating into a total commitment of $8-10 billion that will make it to Indian shores, considering the amount of foreign capital deployed to date by India-based fund managers. Accordingly, the recommendations in this report become even more relevant and critical.9IIIntroduction to the Report and Executive SummaryThe Purpose of the Report2.1.1. Indias economic environment is positive and is going through a period of accelerated growth and innovation. Long-term and stable risk capital is much needed for development to meet the demands of a large population in a competitive and modernizing world. Reforms to promote AIFs in these propitious conditions are well justified as they can significantly increase this steady source of long-term risk capital. With the rising demand for sizable amounts of capital to be invested in India, the AIF industry has a critical need to increase the pool of talented India-based Fund Managers with access to a better and larger deal flow i.e. a strong pipeline of investment opportunities in India.2.1.2. Considering the developing nature of Indias AIF market, many advances in the regulatory framework are needed to promote the supply of risk capital in a prudent fashion. Accordingly, the Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) established the Alternative Investment Policy Advisory Committee (AIPAC).2.1.3. The purpose of the first AIPAC Report is to recommend wide-ranging reforms which India needs to institute in order to create a favourable climate for building a sound alternative investment eco-system in India. The Committee has worked with a solution - finding approach and has evolved recommendations that would help create: a favourable tax environment for investors; unlock domestic sources of venture capital and private equity and other funds for AIFs; enable and encourage onshore fund management in India; and reform the AIF Regulatory regime to facilitate and optimise investments by AIFs.2.1.4. The Committee has taken cognizance of a range of stakeholders and has tried to evolve a 'win-win solution. For the Government, this would result in robust direct and indirect tax collections, creation of more jobs, and acceleration of GDP growth. For SEBI, all alternative assets would come under its supervision; equity markets would be able to attract a greater supply of stable risk capital; and sound portfolio companies in a wide range of economic sectors and established and budding entrepreneurs will be able to attract equity capital to meet their start-up costs, capital expenditure and operating needs.10Fundamental Principles Underlying the Recommendations2.1.5. The recommendations of the Committee are founded on core best practice principles as discussed below:a. Ease of doing business is importantIndia needs to maintain the recent momentum to improve ease of doing business. Cumbersome regulations are hurdles on the start-up and growth of businesses in India as well as in the effective functioning of Alternative Investment Funds which provides much-needed long-term capital to enterprises. Ease of doing business creates a conducive business environment, reduces risk aversion and lowers the cost of doing business resulting in an increased inflow of capital to support new and existing businesses. Ease of doing business increases investor confidence enabling AIFs to provide stable risk capital to a larger universe of portfolio companies more effectively and in greater amounts. This leads to a robust platform, innovation in indigenous technologies, provides jobs, and generates revenue which could be ploughed back for growth and expansion. Nation-building through wealth and job creation in the economy, benefits society, being the end goal of simplifying business regulations.b. Fund managers have the role of Prudent MenBest practice for fund managers is to follow the Prudent Man rule (outlined below), and it is in the interest of the AIF industry to adhere to it. The Prudent Man Rule requires that each investment be judged on its own merit and provides the standard in accordance to which a fiduciary is expected to operate.11innovative and based on careful thought and consideration. A few examples of Next Practices from this report are:Securities Transaction Tax (STT)- based taxation for listed equities,tax pass-through for retail investors in mutual fundsthe concept of accredited investors,simplified investment manager framework,tax efficient Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs), yet tax neutral,recognition of new market participants such as Family Offices, amongst others.India must attempt to develop the next best practice for the AIF industry.d. Clarity, consistency, and certainty in tax policiesIn countries where alternative investments have been immensely successful, a clear and consistent policy framework has been a significant enabler, and this includes a stable tax regime. These criteria clarity, certainty and consistencyin policy\timpact the growth of the venture capital and private equity ecosystem, and the funds' ability to attract capital and provide efficient, tax-adjusted returns. For example, funds are pooling vehicles for their investors, and the universally applicable principle is of a single-level of taxation in the hands of investors, also known as limited partners (LPs). In a globalized world, where countries compete for capital, the success of alternative investments in the medium to long-term depends on Indias tax policy for alternative investments being globally competitive.e.\tHarmonisation and consistency across different regulatorsIt is vital that the recommendations of the Committee are coherently coordinated and harmonized across different regulators such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and others. For AIFs to work seamlessly, they need to be treated equally and on par by all stakeholders and regulators.f.\tAIFs should at least have parity with public market funds in tax policiesInvestments in venture capital and private equity funds are risky, commonly illiquid, and relatively longer term in nature. Accordingly, venture capital and private equity funds should, at the very least, have a tax regime that is on par with that applicable to investors in public markets.13Summary of Recommendations2.1.6. The four chapters that follow focus on the four forces that will drive the progress and contribution of the AIF industry.I. Creating a Favourable Tax Environment2.2.1. The tax recommendations are aimed at bringing about ease of doing business ensuring neutrality, clarity, consistency and certainty in the tax policy; helping increase the confidence of investors, fund managers and entrepreneurs; and establishing parity in tax policies between alternative investments and public market investments.2.2.2. Once implemented, the recommendations will help attract significantly more capital from offshore and Indian investors into Indian private equity and venture capital, including SEBI-regulated Alternative Investment Funds.i.\tMake Tax Pass-Through Work Effectively: The tax pass through system of taxation of AIFs ensures that investors do not pay more tax than they would, had they made the investments directly themselves. AIFs are simply vehicles that pool the savings of investors for professional fund management over a long-term period. Accordingly the pass-through method should be made to work flawlessly with simplicity. This requires the immediate implementation of the following:a)\tThe exempt income of AIFs should not suffer tax withholding of 10%.b)\tExempt investors should not suffer withholding tax of 10%.c)\tInvestment gains of AIFs should be deemed to be capital gains in nature.d)\tThe tax rules applicable to investment funds in Chapter XII-B of the Act should be extended to all categories of AIFs.e)\tLosses incurred by AIFs should be available for set-off to their investors.f)\tNon-resident investors should be subject to rates in force in the respective Double Tax Avoidance Agreements.ii.\tEliminate Deemed Income: It is important to recognize the basic principle that investments made in portfolio companies are capital contributions and not the income of the portfolio company. Similarly, the income of an AIF arises only when it receives dividend or interest income during the holding period, or realises capital gains at the time of exit. In order to be consistent with these principles, AIFs and portfolio companies should be exempted from section 56(2)(viia) and 56(2)(viib), respectively, of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act).14iii. Taxation upon sale and reduced taxation rates for unlisted shares acquired via ESOPs/employee incentive schemes;iv. Clarify tax rate of 10% on long term capital gains to be applicable on transfer of shares of private limited companies ;v. Taxation of convertible preference shares/ debentures based on the holding period reckoned from the date of investment rather than the date of conversion;vi. AIFs to be permissible investments of charitable and religious trusts ;vii. Taxation on conversion/ transfer of Global Depository Receipts issued against permitted securities (other than listed shares) ; andviii. Service tax in respect of capital raised by an AIF from overseas investors. A clarification should be provided that investors in funds are the service recipients of the services provided by a fund manager/ service provider.The proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act have been included in this report wherever possible.II.\tUnlocking Domestic Capital Pools2.3.1. India has an urgent need to unlock domestic capital pools for investment as private equity and venture capital. This is due to factors such as:i.\tLarge Capital Needs: Given that India is large economy, it needs to invest sizeable volumes of long-term capital every year to help create jobs across the nation, build new infrastructure, and become innovative in addressing challenges while being globally competitive.ii. Risk Aversion of Traditional Forms of Finance: In a rapidly growing economy that is encouraging entrepreneurship, and where start-ups, and medium and large enterprises have a rising need for risk capital across various stages  start up, growth, listing and recovery - traditional funding sources have a limited ability and are constrained by risk aversion.iii. Public Capital Markets have limited funds and are volatile: A dynamic entrepreneurial eco-system requires strong and stable capital flows and substantial equity infusion. The public capital markets can only cater to a small part of this need and are subject to market volatility.2.3.2. Fund Managers need access to capital both from domestic and foreign pools.Several important capital pools\tpensions, insurance, DFIs and banks, aswell as pools of charitable institutions\tneed appropriate risk-adjustedreturns. AIFs provide their corpuses with significant returns when prudently managed in a favourable economic environment.172.4.7.\tThe chapter titled Promoting Onshore Fund Management provides numerical examples of the tax impact of the withholding tax approach and the STT approach to illustrate the benefits of the latter. It shows that the withholding tax regime creates undue hardships and is inconsistent with the need for ease of business. On the other hand, the suggested STT regime will simplify taxation of AIFs.2.4.8.\tGreater operational freedom for India-domiciled AIFs will attract more offshore capital into them. Such freedom requires a disclosure-based approach to regulation. In addition, there needs to be greater flexibility in the regulations such as for investing in offshore companies.2.4.9.\tThe chapter also shows that venture capital and private equity portfolio companies are major sustainable tax generators, not the venture capital and private equity funds in themselves.IV.\tReforming the AIF Regulatory Regime2.5.1. In order to sustain the continued growth of the AIF industry, the path ahead requires reforms in the enabling regulatory framework for AIFs. While most regulatory efforts have rightly focused on protecting minority shareholder interests and improving compliance, there has been limited direct regulatory effort focused on the private equity and venture capital industry itself.There have been considerable developments recently, for example the pass-through approach introduced in the Union Budget 2015 and the Reserve Bank of Indias AIF investment policy liberalising investments in AIFs. Sustained reforms in a few areas could further grow the industry. These include a current and rationalised approach, an awareness of merging boundaries of different pools, a consistent and simple framework harmonized across regulators, and a sharply defined clarity on investment boundaries.The Committees recommendations cover:i.\tRegulation of fund manager and not the fundii.\tMinor amendments to existing AIF regulations to include growth in the definition of venture capital funds under Category I AIFsiii. Classification of Category III AIFs2.5.2. The report clearly indicates the road ahead through specific recommendations supported by underlying principles, best practices, and the much larger vision of economic growth which shapes and sustains the quality of human lives.19Further, there are many instances where the fund managers wish to manage a small set of investors who could provide them with relatively large pools of capital to manage. The following are illustrative situations of providing good cases for management of offshore funds in India, but where the diversification of investor base may not be relevant:Management of a large global family office.Management of a part of the funds allocated by a large investor (e.g. sovereign wealth fund or a pension fund) to be managed by a domestic fund manager.Global propriety funds of development and other financial institutions (like banks and insurance companies) being managed by domestic asset managers in India.New fund managers looking at raising commitments may be able to achieve diversification only after they have established a reasonable track record.All new funds could have anchor investors who would clearly hold more than 5% of the total holding. These anchor investors are critical for the success of the fund managers.The diversification may be achieved over multiple fund closings but the asset management has to start immediately from first closing of the fund.There are many domestic asset managers who wish to manage global pools of capital but who may not be able to meet diversification related conditions given the regulatory restrictions in marketing and distribution of the financial products in various jurisdictions.34D.IV Taxation upon sale, and reduced taxation rates for unlisted shares acquired via ESOPs/employee incentive schemes4.1 There are two severe tax events that occur upon exercise of options granted to founders and early employees of VCPE companies.4.2 First, the employee is subject to tax at the time of exercise of option  i.e. this tax is payable immediately even if the employee has not sold the share in that tax period. The magnitude of the tax is calculated on the notional gain between the acquisition price of the share (option strike price) and the FMV at the time of exercise. In other words, the employee becomes liable for a significant cash tax for exercise of options amounting to a notional non-cash gain.4.3\tSecondly, the nature of such gains is considered as salary or perquisite.This means that the employee may be payable for ordinary income tax (30+%, calculated as per the marginal income tax rate) for the notional gains calculated above  which will be a substantial amount in a successful company.4.4 Rather perversely, this means that 1) the tax rate suffered by employees (with option vesting periods of 4+ years) is generally higher than 2) the tax rate suffered by their investors who hold the investment for 3+ years which in turn is greater than 3) the tax rate suffered by investors who subscribe to shares in the IPO or Offer for sale and hold for 1+ years. The relevant rates are 1) ordinary income i.e. 30+% vs. 2) long term capital gains tax on unlisted sales i.e. 20% after indexation vs. 3) long term capital gains tax on listed sales i.e. 0%.469.2 Under the present service tax legislation, services whose place of supply (determined in terms of the relevant rules) is in India are subject to service tax at 14%.9.3 Further, services provided by service providers located in India to service recipients located outside India can qualify as exports and be treated as zero-rated services, subject to the fulfilment of the following prescribed conditions cumulatively:^\tService provider is located in India^\tService recipient is located outside India^\tService should not be an exempted service, as per the service tax legislation^\tPlace of supply of service should be outside India in terms of the relevant rules^\tPayment of services is received by service provider in convertible foreign exchange^\tService provider and recipient should be separate legal entities. and not merely different establishments of the same legal entity9.4\tA fund is, in essence, the pooling in of the contributions of its investorsfor the purpose of investment and therefore does have any distinct entity apart from its investors. However, for the purpose of levy of service tax in India, a fund is viewed as a distinct person. Accordingly, under the present service tax legislation, services provided by a fund manager (and other service providers) to a fund located in India are taxable, irrespective of the location of its investors.9.5 It is relevant to note that in such a scenario, the taxing principle of service tax, i.e. consumption-based taxation, is not being met in respect of overseas investors. This is on account of the fact that the Fund is considered for determination of the consumption of the services provided by the fund manager, whereas the actual effective consumption of the said services is by the investors and not the fund.9.6 If the principle of effective consumption were to be followed, the services to the extent of the investments made by the overseas investors would be outside the purview of service tax in India, as the place of supply of the said services is outside India, i.e. the location of the effective service recipient (overseas investors). Further, the said services shall also qualify as exports and be treated as zero rated services as all of the conditions prescribed for the export qualification are being met in essence, for e.g., the fee for asset management53Annexure 3USA: Accredited InvestorsUnder the Securities Act of 1933, a company that offers or sells its securities must register the securities with the SEC, or find an exemption from the registration requirements. The Act provides companies with a number of exemptions. For some of the exemptions from registration requirements of federal securities laws, a company may sell its securities to what are known as \"accredited investors.The federal securities laws define the term accredited investor in Rule 501 of Regulation D as:1. A bank, insurance company, registered investment company, business development company, or small business investment company;2.\tAn employee benefit plan, within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, if a bank, insurance company, or registered investment adviser makes the investment decisions, or if the plan has total assets in excess of US$5 million;3.\tA charitable organization, corporation, or partnership with assets exceeding US $5 million;4.\tA director, executive officer, or general partner of the company selling the securities;5.\tA business in which all the equity owners are accredited investors;6.\tA natural person who has individual net worth, or joint net worth with the persons spouse, that exceeds US$1 million at the time of the purchase, excluding the value of the primary residence of such person;7.\tA natural person with income exceeding US$200,000 in each of the two most recent years, or joint income with a spouse exceeding US$300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year; or a trust with assets in excess of US$5 million, not formed to acquire the securities offered, whose purchases a sophisticated person makes.77A. Pension Funds4.3.1 Pension funds have long-term liabilities which need to be matched by longterm assets. They need to invest in a broadly diversified set of asset classes. In the U.S., pension funds began to invest in private equity and venture capital in the late 1970s. Subsequently, pension funds in Europe, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa and many other countries began to allocate a portion of their investible funds in private equity and venture capital.4.3.2 The paradoxical situation in India is that while leading overseas pension funds invest in Indian private equity and venture capital, domestic Indian pension funds have not yet begun to invest in Indian private equity and venture capital opportunities. In several countries, pension funds are the dominant source of capital for such private equity and venture capital funds. The Government of India has taken the progressive step to establish a regulatory authority called the Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority (PFRDA). The PFRDAs publication titled Report of the Committee to Review Investment Guidelines for National Pension System Schemes in the Private Sector 4 has recommended investment in private equity and venture capital.RecommendationsI.\tDomestic pension funds in India, including those managed/ regulated by PFRDA (National Pension System-NPS) and the Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO), should allocate up to 3% of their assets to AIF by 2017, rising to 5% by 2020, as they gain more experience.II.\tImplement a prudent investor regime, i.e. establish an institutional architecture comprising of trained investment teams, including Chief Investment Officers, and Investment Committees for AIF investing by mid-2016. The investment function should include an investment committee and investment monitoring staff and an appropriate investment process. This should include an investment advisory committee consisting of persons with expertise and experience in investments.JustificationI.\tDiversification of investments requires exposure to a broad array of asset classes, including AIFs.4 http://pfrda.org.in/myauth/admin/showimg.cshtml?ID=68280^\tIRDA, in August, 2013, permitted Insurance Companies to invest in Category 1 & 2 AIFs but placed low limits on AIF Investments: Life Insurance - 3 % and General Insurance-5%.^\tAn operational hurdle is that AIF investments are categorised as Unapproved Investments requiring Board Approval in addition to Investment Committee Approval.^\tAnother important hurdle is that Insurance companies are not allowed to invest in Fund-of-Funds (FOFs). FOFs are a common investment medium for all types of institutions. They are also subject to SEBI regulation.RecommendationsI.\tEnable investments in all types of Category 1 & 2 AIFs as well as unlevered Category 3 AIFs.II.\tAIF investments should fall in the Approved Category to enable investment approval by Investment Committees, rather than Boards, subject to internal prudential guidelines.III. Increase the maximum exposure for Life Insurance Companies to AIFs from 3% to 5% and to 10% by 2020 for both Life and General Insurers.IV.\tPermit investment in Fund-of-Funds (FOFs).JustificationThese recommendations are justified on the following grounds:I.\tInsurance Companies have long-term liabilities, which make AIF a suitable long-term asset class.II.\tInternal processes should be streamlined to enhance investments.III.\tGeneral Insurers are already permitted a higher allocation of 5%, and the allocation for life insurers should have parity. FoFs are a legitimate investment category for making AIF investments since there is an added layer of due diligence by the FOF Fund Manager.D. Banks4.6.1 There is a sound rationale for banks to allocate a prudent amount of their funds to private equity. Firstly, while banks have access mainly to short-term resources, they also have access to longer-term funds. Secondly, banks have a strategic rationale for investing in private equity and venture capital. This is primarily to find potential banking clients from the portfolio companies of funds in which they have invested.834.6.2\tBetween 1983 and 2009, 30% of all U.S. private equity investments (representing over US$700 billion of transaction value) were sponsored by the Private Equity arm of a large bank. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the passing of the 'Volcker Rule' as part of the Dodd-Frank Act required banks to limit their exposure to Private Equity and Hedge Funds to no more than 3% of their Tier 1 capital. 64.6.3\tBanks as guardians of depositors savings, need to institute risk management safeguards to ensure prudent investing in private equity and venture capital funds.4.6.4\tSVF invest primarily in securities or units of social ventures / enterprises thus satisfying social performance norms laid down by the fund. The overall returns of SVF are at two levels, the absolute financial returns which could be marginally muted (i.e. lower than the returns expectations for similar investments), and returns in the form of formation of social capital which is of very high importance to the inclusive growth of the economy.RecommendationsI. Lower the risk weight attached to investments in AIFs and increase investment limits for banks from 10% to 20% of the total corpus of an AIF (and to 25% for SVFs).II.\tAIF investments, where the investment objectives are consistent with the needs of the priority sector, should be treated as priority sector investment and not impact the bank's capital market exposure.JustificationI.\tStrategic Benefits: Successful portfolio companies of AIFs can become bank clients.II.\tRisk Management: Investing in AIFs is a risk management tool because they are professionally managed and have a diversified portfolio which is regularly monitored by an external fund manager for value-addition.6 COMBINING BANKING WITH PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTINGLily Fang, Victoria Ivashina & Josh Lerner, athttps://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/personal/lfang/research/documents/5.CombiningBa nkingandPEInvesting.pdf84E. Accredited Investors4.7.1\tNot all investors have the capacity, or the risk tolerance for investing in AIFs because they are illiquid, unlisted and closed-ended investment vehicles. Given that SEBI has already introduced the concept of Accredited Investors (AI) in the AIF Regulations for Angel Funds, the concept could be made applicable to all other categories of AIFs with such modifications as may be appropriate. The criteria for AIs may also be based on past tax assessments indicating net worth and annual cash flows being over a defined threshold as is the case in the U.S.4.7.2\tAccredited investors should not be required to register with SEBI. AIF Regulations currently require an investor to invest at least Rs. 1 crore in an AIF. This is to ensure that only sophisticated investors invest in such AIFs considering the risk involved in such investments.4.7.3\tGlobally, instead, the concept of Accredited Investors is applied where an investor who satisfies a certain minimum income, or asset, or net worth thresholds is considered to be an accredited investor and can make such investments. Such investors are usually self-certified, for instance, in countries like USA (Refer Annexure 2 for U.S. law on accredited investors).RecommendationsIn line with global practice, it is proposed that the individuals who satisfy the following conditions should be recognised as Accredited Investors:I.\tCapable of identifying the potential investments and its underlying risks.II.\tPossess sufficient financial sophistication to take on the risks associated with the investment offerings.III.\tHave a sound financial track record, i.e. reported total income (including exempt income) exceeding Rs 50 lakhs annually in three assessment years immediately preceding the assessment year in which the investment is proposed to be made.IV.\tIt is also proposed to link the Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the investor in the electronic database of the revenue authorities with the total income (including exempt income) of the investor in a manner such that it is easier to determine whether the investor qualifies as an Accredited Investor.85V.\tSince the VCF Regulations have been superseded by the SEBI (AIF) Regulations, a similar exemption should be extended to Category I AIF and Category II AIF.JustificationI.\tThe concept of Accredited Investors will simplify the process of determining who are eligible investors in AIFs and will be a factor in ease of doing business; andII.\tIt will ensure that investors who regard themselves as capably of identifying the risks consistent with their risk tolerance and capacity, consider investing in AIFs.F. Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs)4.8.1 The AIF industry will be more in touch with, and more in tune with the issues of India if a significant fraction of pooled funds are domiciled, structured and raised in India. The current level of domestic investment in AIFs is very low, leading several AIFs not to raise money in India at all. This is very different in a country such as the US, where LLPs are the typical structure for establishing AIFs.4.8.2\tCurrently, the Registrar of Companies (RoC) does not allow LLPs to be set upwith investment in the objects section of the charter documents. The RBI also does not oversee LLPs as they are not companies, even though there are well-defined rules of when a Company is required to register with RBI. The requirement, then, is to cultivate more sophisticated limited partners (LPs) in India, and bring them on the same level playing field as foreign LPs. and formally allow (under Registrar of Companies) proprietary domestic capital to set up an LLP as an investment vehicle.RecommendationI.\tThe Registrar of Companies should allow LLPs to be registered for theobject of investment, provided that they self-certify that all the capital is contributed by the partners, and that they do not accept public deposits or use borrowed funds.86JustificationI. This is essential as it allows a large LP to manage all their costs, gains, losses and risk exposures tax efficiently in one place (across several India investments, for example), while still ensuring that tax disputes do not flow upwards and outwards to their other global activities.II.\tAn LLP is the ideal investment vehicle as (i) it is a body corporate from a legal and tax perspective and (ii) it offers one layer of taxation for all partners. Being a body corporate, it also allows the LLP to invest some multiple of its net worth overseas (albeit only in actively managed investments) in a regulated manner as prescribed by RBI.G. Single Family Officesa.\tFollowing the liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991, new, professional and established entrepreneurs have created new ventures by harnessing their technical and managerial prowess as well as Indias human resource talent. This has created lakhs of jobs and helped grow Indias export earnings. At the same time, the value of the assets of successful entrepreneurs has grown manifold. Given their success in India, these entrepreneurs have been willing to deploy and invest their resulting wealth in India.4.9.2\tThe primary sources of the entrepreneurial wealth are earnings gained from operating entrepreneurial ventures and from the sale of businesses to other parties i.e. liquidity events. The combined wealth of such successful entrepreneurs is a significant source of domestic capital that can potentially be invested in AIFs. This wealth needs to be prudently invested for inter-generational transfers, and at the same time invested in ventures that benefit the Indian economy, create jobs and promote innovation and creativity.4.9.3\tSome of the ventures of these entrepreneurs have been funded by private equity and venture capital funds. Accordingly, they have a good understanding of the Alternative Investment Fund asset class comprising of venture capital, private equity and social venture funds.4.9.4\tTwo important characteristics of entrepreneurial wealth are:Firstly, being inter-generational in nature, such wealth can be invested in illiquid, long-term asset classes such as venture capital and private equity.87Given the risk-loving nature of the entrepreneurs who created this wealth, they are willing to invest a part of this pool of capital in venture capital and private equity.Secondly, being entrepreneurs themselves, they have the capability to add value to venture capital and private equity portfolio companies by providing mentorship, business management ideas as well as introductions to their business networks which can contribute in a major way to the success of the portfolio companies of AIFs.The investment activity of entrepreneurially-created wealth is increasingly managed by Single or Multi-Family Offices. This represents a substantial domestic pool of capital for which the regulatory framework should provide various investment avenues, including AIFs.RecommendationsI.\tSingle Family Offices to be allowed to register specified investment vehicles as Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs)II.\tSpecifically state that Family Offices and dedicated state funded vehicles can be registered AIFsJustificationI.\tOver the past 20 years, several entrepreneurs have established family offices to manage their funds in a diversified and sophisticated way. Their capital needs to be mobilized for investment and development in as many ways as possible. This is similar to the evolution of the venture capital and private equity industry in the United States.II.\tThese Family Offices are not recognized as having institutional status, and consequently cannot participate in particular kinds of domestic transactions (e.g. QIP except via retail book) though they can add substantial value alongside AIFs and FVCIs.H. Non-Resident Indians (NRIs)4.10.1\tNon-Resident Indians have a natural affinity to India. Unlike most other foreign investors, they have additional reasons to invest in India. These include the natural desire to engage with the motherland, utilise personal and business networks in the homeland, take advantage of local language skills and make a contribution to Indias businesses and institutions by way88I. Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs)FVCI are mainly overseas pension funds, endowment fund, sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies. They are permitted to invest in India under the FVCI regime, which has been in existence for the past 15 years.FVCI is principally governed by three sets of regulations:I.\tSEBI registers Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) and regulates investments by FVCIs in India under SEBI (Foreign Venture Capital Investors) Regulations, 2000 (FVCI Regulations). FVCIs are investors incorporated and established outside India investing primarily in venture capital undertakings in India either directly or through venture capital fund(s)/alternative investment funds.II.\tRBI through Schedule 6 of the Foreign Exchange Management (TISPRO) Regulations, 2000, also regulates the flow of capital through the FVCI route. Infrastructure is one among 10 sectors in which RBI has permitted investment under the FVCI route.III.\tThe Consolidated FDI Policy requires FVCI investors to obtain specific approval of the Government for each investment in an AIF.Benefits of FVCII.\tFVCI are covered in this report because they are potentially a large source of long term capital. As on 30 September 2014, there were 197 FVCI registered with SEBI with a cumulative capital of Rs. 42,2776 crore. Further FVCI investment in the infrastructure sector as on 30th September 2014 amounted to more than Rs. 20,000 crore i.e. nearly half of the total cumulative net investment by FVCIs in India. Major investment by FVCI in the infrastructure sector is in power, telecom, roads, bridges, and urban infrastructure.II.\tFVCI and AIFs are interlinked in that FVCI investors should be able to invest in AIFs which are regulated by SEBI. As many FVCIs are highly experienced venture capital and private equity investors, their direct presence in an Indian AIF has a positive demonstration effect. Such FVCI investment in AIFs, will be a source of confidence amongst domestic investors who have limited experience in these asset classes. This, in turn, will help attract domestic investors, including pension funds, into AIFs as well as assist in the growth of domestic fund managers. Ultimately, the pool of domestic capital for domestic investment through AIFs will rise thereby making available more stable capital for domestic enterprises.91III.\tPrivate equity and venture capital are long-term stable capital. In recent years, they have been the only form of long term capital available to startups or growth companies, or infrastructure projects. This is potentially a significant source of capital for ventures and projects in India and India should have a regulatory framework that makes it easy for FVCIs to invest in India. Unlisted companies do not have access to the stock market, but can raise capital from FVCIs.IV.\tThis form of capital is vital to make a success of Indias 'Make in India' program. Ultimately, the development and growth resulting from FVCI leads to greater employment in portfolio companies.V.\tFVCI investors require the highest standards of corporate governance in portfolio companies which is consistent with the objectives of various regulators like SEBI, RBI and the various Ministries.The FVCI regime has been in existence for 15 years. Market participants are now familiar with the procedures involved. Hence, it should continue with further improvements in the regulatory landscape covering FVCI. FVCI investment should be welcomed in all categories of AIFs. All AIF categories are regulated by SEBI and have the necessary checks and balances.Reforms Needed in the FVCI Regimea)\tChoice of Investment Structures to be liberalizedSeveral FVCIs are a part of large substantial pools of capital running into billions of dollars. It is quite normal for various arms to employ different investment strategies and deal and fund formation structures. FVCIs should be permitted to invest in AIFs via any structure, namely trusts, LLPs, company or body corporate which they consider suitable.Across the world a variety of fund formation structures have been employed to channel private equity and venture capital for decades. All these methods of fund formation should also be available in India, thereby making India a jurisdiction, which is investor, including FVCI, friendly.b)\tSector Restrictions to be liberalizedIt is recommended that restrictions placed by RBI limiting FVCI investments to only 10 sectors should be removed. The rationale for this is that almost every significant sector of the Indian economy is in need of private equity92and venture capital and hence a wide array of sectors should be accessible to FVCI investors. This is consistent with the 'Make in India' policy. If the Government so wishes, there can be a small negative list but this should be very narrow so that significant long term stable capital flows are not restricted, but instead should be welcomed.c)\tContinuation of benefits under the current frameworkThe existing benefits offered to FVCIs should continue. This was also suggested by the June, 2013 K M Chandrashekhar Committee report titled 'Rationalisation of Investment Routes and Monitoring of Foreign Portfolio Investments'.The rationale is principally twofold:Firstly, any perception that the country is backing down on previous arrangements may not be viewed favourably amongst the domestic and global investment community. This may ultimately hurt the investee companies, which need long term capital.Secondly, the benefits are not of a tax nature, and hence have no adverse effect on the tax revenues of the country. On the other hand, a more liberal FVCI regime would help attract more capital, leading to more growth at the investee company level ultimately leading to higher tax revenues to the nation.The Pricing Benefit: FVCIs may acquire by purchase or otherwise or sell shares/convertible debentures/units or any other investment held by it in the VCUs or VCFs or schemes/funds set up by the VCFs at a price that is mutually acceptable to the buyer and the seller/issuer.A price which is mutually acceptable to a buyer and a seller is ultimately the basis of a sound valuation. Such valuations are usually backed by a formal valuation analysis of the two parties. Accordingly this system of valuation applied to FVCI should continue.d) Automatic RouteGiven the benefits of FVCIs highlighted above, the FDI policy should allow investment vide an automatic route, subject to compliance with SEBIs AIF regulations.e)\tFDI policy to permit FVCI investment under the automatic route' 93RecommendationsI.\tA general permission should be provided under the FDI Policy enabling investments by FVCI in all AIFs (including AIFs set up as trusts) under the automatic route.II.\tRemove RBIs 10 sector restrictions.III.\tInstitute a single-stage approval of FVCI at the level of SEBI-approved Designated Depository Participant (DDP) on behalf of SEBI as is the case with FPIs.IV.\tThe existing benefits offered to FVCIs should continue. This was also suggested by the June 2013 K M Chandrashekhar Committee report titled 'Rationalisation of Investment Routes and Monitoring of Foreign Portfolio Investments'.JustificationI.\tFVCIs are a large pool of offshore capital, which can boost the Indian fund management industry. Alignment: Many FVCIs would prefer to invest in a domestic AIF since local investors have skin in the game. The presence of FVCIs will also be a confidence booster for domestic investors of AIF. Potential increase in employment in several sectors. Single-stage approval by DDPs will substantially ease the doing of business by FVCI s in India.II.\tRisk capital is needed not just by 10 sectors but by almost every sector of the Indian economy.J.\tInitial Public Offerings (IPOs)IPO treatment for AIFsMost IPOs have a restricted allocation for equity mutual funds. Furthermore, mutual funds are currently allowed to anchor an IPO, even if the lead manager is a group company. As per SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009, SCHEDULE XI (point 10(k)), neither the merchant bankers nor any person related to the promoter/promoter group/merchant bankers can apply under anchor Investor category in a public issue. The only exception given by SEBI is for mutual fund entities related to merchant banker.RecommendationsI.\tAllow all AIFs to get an allocation in an IPO.II.\tAIFs to be allowed to anchor an IPO, even if the lead manager is a group company.943. Angel FundsSEBI has done an admirable job of trying to solve the problems created by Section 56 (2) (vii b) of the Income Tax Act which taxes investment in a company made above the Fair Market Value by creating a new category of AIF Category I for Angel Groups. While not optimal (angel groups are not regulated anywhere in the world), this route can be utilized by angel groups with the below recommended changes.i.\tThe stipulation that angel investors must remain invested in a company for a minimum of 3 years should ideally be removed (AIF Category 1 Funds do not have it ) or at least be brought down to one year, if at all a minimum holding period is required.This is onerous and, in fact, counterproductive for the investee companys interests as many companies that receive angel investments (especially those that are doing well) need more money within 12 to 24 months. Most VCs who are willing to make larger investments insist that they clean out the earlier shareholding and buy out the angel investors as they do not want the clutter of 30 or 40 angel investors to deal with. The other source of capital is from corporates (investment or acquisition) who also want to buy out the angels for the same reason. This 3 year lock in may, therefore, deny a company the funds it desperately needs and that would be detrimental to its interests.Angel Investors, on their part, would like to exit when they can, and then invest in the next start up. Most of them have a certain amount of money earmarked for angel investments and if they cannot exit their current holdings, they will not invest in new companies. This lock in will therefore be counterproductive to the objective of breeding more start-ups.Also, exiting angel investments is a difficult and delicate affair and lockins will make the process sub-optimal for investors. Such liquidity and circulation of capital can also be facilitated if the investments of some angels are acquired by other angels in the same group, depending on their interests and financial capabilities.If there are compelling reasons why this lock in provision cannot be removed entirely or reduced to one year, then an alternative route would be to insert a proviso to regulation 19F(3) of the AIF Regulations as follows:Provided that an angel fund could transfer its investment before the completion of the three year lock-in period to:96any SEBI registered fund;any overseas fund/investor which is either an appropriately regulated entity;an overseas fund whose investment manager or parent company is appropriately regulated;a strategic buyer being a body corporate, incorporated in India or overseas: andany other investor in the angel fund.Explanation: For the purposes of this clause, an overseas fund / investor shall be considered to be \"appropriately regulated\" if it is regulated or supervised by a market regulator or the banking regulator of the concerned overseas jurisdiction.ii.\tThe provision that each angel investor needs to invest Rs. 25 lakh over 3 years should be allowed for the life of the fund, or at least raised to 5 years for the following reasons:This will be impractical because though an investor may wish to do so, he may be unable to do so as the network /angel group may simply not be able to offer sufficient number of investment opportunities in the angel investors area of interest.Also, most angel groups rules allow investors to share the investment on a pari passu basis. Therefore, an individual member may make a number of investments but, because they tend to be over 30 or 40 investors in each investment, he may not reach Rs. 25 lakh in 3 years.There would be periods when there would not be enough opportunities due to reasons of macro-economic outlook. Slow growth economic trends do not provide a conducive environment for high growth companies.iii.\tThe provision that the angel fund needs to invest a minimum of Rs. 50 lakhs in a company should be brought down to Rs. 25 lakh, as this will encourage start-ups.iv.\tAIF Regulations be amended to allow a scheme to have a maximum of 200 investors.Currently, no scheme of the angel fund shall have more than 49 angel investors. This provision was inserted to be in-line with the Companies Act, 1956 wherein, over 50 investors in a company would make it deemed public. Since this provision has been changed in the Companies Act, 2013 to 200 shareholders, we would97request that the AIF Regulations be amended to allow a scheme to have a maximum of 200 investors.v.\tThe provision that angel funds shall invest only in venture capital undertakings which have been incorporated during the preceding three years from the date of such investment. This should be modified to allow at least 10% of the angel funds portfolio investments to be companies that may be more than 3 years old.Often an investee company comes up with a new idea or product after 3 years of its incorporation but the entrepreneurs dont set up a new company for the new idea/product to avoid incurring additional costs and do it within the existing company (this is also because closing a company is a very tiresome and complex process). In such a situation, an angel fund shall not be able to invest in such idea/product, which is a detrimental regulation.It is, of course, assumed that this clause shall not restrict a further investment in the same company, if the first investment has taken place as per norms.vi.\tAngel funds should also be allowed to invest in overseas venture fund undertakings, the same percentage of their corpus as other AIF I categories.Angel Investors who invest at the highest risk level of a venture fund risk mitigate their investments through various means. One way of spreading the risks is by investing across geographies. We would recommend that similar to other venture funds under Category I, angel funds should also be allowed to invest the same percentage of their corpus in overseas venture fund undertakings as in venture funds. The venture should ideally have an India connection.Private Placements of Small VenturesRule 14(2)(c) of Chapter III of the Companies Act, 2013 states that a private placement shall not be for an investment size of less than INR 20,000 of the face value of the securities (Minimum Investment Size). Issuance of shares with a high face value is unduly onerous for start-up companies, is entrepreneur unfriendly and forces a start-up to issue Rs.20, 000 worth shares at par to any investor, when the investor is willing to pay a premium.98Recommendationsa. The process should be simplified. For example, the requirement of issuing an offer letter for a preferential issue should be done away with at least for private companies, as in any case persons who invest in a private company would conduct their due diligence since there is no free market for the securities of a private company unlike a listed company.b. To comply with the above, companies need to increase their authorised capital which entails unnecessary expense to companies.c. The minimum investment size requirement serves no purpose and instead just adds an unnecessary restriction/compliance requirement for companies desirous of raising capital. It should be deleted.99VPromoting Onshore Fund Management in IndiaA. Introduction5.1 Currently, approximately 95% of venture capital and private equity capital is contributed by overseas investors, and given the paucity of a domestic investor pool, overseas investors will continue to be major contributors to venture capital and private equity in the foreseeable future. The majority of overseas investors (98% of total foreign VCPE capital) and their venture capital and private equity fund managers prefer to domicile their funds in countries with stable and favourable tax and regulatory regimes on fund management.5.2 Offshore funds typically invest in Indian companies through Indias Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or the Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) routes rather than establishing domestic funds domiciled in India. This is because their FDI and FPI regimes are considered to be far more consistent in contrast to the changing tax and regulatory regimes specific to VCPE Funds in India. Since such fund vehicles are domiciled offshore, they do not fall in the ambit of SEBIs regulatory regime for Alternative Investment Funds.5.3\tThe majority of offshore venture capital and private equity funds are managedby fund managers located outside India. The key question is why is the current regulatory and tax regime driving more than 95% of venture capital and private equity fund managers overseas and causing more than 95% of the India focused VCPE funds to be domiciled overseas. This is because, albeit inadvertently, the current regulatory and tax regime is severely disadvantageous to fund managers domiciled in India, resulting in the exodus of the fund management industry to foreign shores.5.4 The two major factors which have led to this situation are (i) the lack of tax clarity and (ii) severe restrictions on the operational freedom of fund managers domiciled in India. These reasons are critical to the extent that it puts the economics of an entire fund under peril, if domiciled in India. Therefore, fund managers who would have otherwise preferred to domicile in India, have been forced to setup their operations overseas.5.5\tIndia needs to create a level playing field between fund managers domiciled inIndia and those located offshore, which is not the case in India currently. A level playing field will help India realize the multiple benefits of attracting VCPE fund managers to India.100B.\tTax Clarity5.6\tAn ideal tax and regulatory framework should have features which enable India focused fund vehicles to be pooled or located in India and fund managers, who manage these funds, to operate locally. This model of funds and their management established in local jurisdictions is common among developed economies. This, in turn, contributes to a thriving venture capital and private equity industry. More to the point, many progressive economies have proactively taken measures to attract venture capital and private equity managers to their host jurisdictions for the obvious reasons of the beneficial impact on their economies  creation of a robust eco-system to boost entrepreneurship, creation of jobs and increased GDP growth.5.7\tThe suggestions and recommendations made in this chapter are easily implementable, transformative in nature and should trigger the growth of a vibrant venture capital and private equity industry in India. These can lead to benefits to India in the shape of growth in annual tax revenues for the exchequer. Accordingly, the recommendations should be implemented on a priority basis. Transformative steps which would encourage venture capital and private equity funds to be domiciled in India would be to:a. Create parity between Indian regulations and those offshore and with their respective double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAA).b. Allow foreign investment from international limited partners directly into domestic alternative investment funds (AIFs) by bringing changes to the foreign exchange regulations (FDI policy/FEMA) and the policy on tax deducted at source.c.\tCreate a level playing field between the fund managers domiciled in India and those located offshore, which is not the case in India currently.d.\tEnable more foreign funds to be domiciled in India and brought under the purview of SEBI by ensuring clear policies and their consistent application over the entire life of fund vehicles. The STT based regime has been in vogue for a decade in India and is a time-tested method of taxation, which ensures easy and efficient collection of taxes at source. STT reduces the compliance burden on the funds to a great extent and ensures upfront collection of taxes to the revenue. STT could be levied on both entry as well as exit from Funds. STT would also reduce the scrutiny burden of the revenue authorized and consequent reduction in the litigation.101e.\tPrior to the introduction of an STT regime, as an interim measure, it is recommended that CBDT immediately clarifies that exempt income flowing through AIFs should not suffer any withholding tax.f.\tAmend the safe-harbour norms for ease of doing business5.8\tThe committee has worked with a solution-finding approach and has evolved a set of recommendations that would enable and encourage onshore fund management. The two must-do items that would greatly help the cause are a) tweaking Safe harbour norms and b) implementing the STT approach to taxation on investments / distributions by Indian AIFs.5.9\tIn making its recommendations, the committee has taken cognizance of all the stakeholders and has tried to evolve a 'win-win solution. For the Government, this would result in robust direct/indirect tax collections, creation of more jobs, and acceleration of GDP growth. For SEBI, all alternative assets would come under its supervision; equity markets would be able to attract stable and deeper investment base. SEBI would be the key enabler of increasing domestic participation in venture capital and private equity, and there would be complete oversight on any systemic risk possibilities. For the tax authorities, the STT approach to taxation is superior to the tax pass-through approach and would result in less litigation while still maximizing tax revenues and availability of full audit trail.5.10 The government should attract as much venture capital and private equity capital into India as possible, by creating enabling regulations. One of the key benefits of such capital inflows for India would be higher tax revenues for the government. To put the revenue generation potential of venture capital and private equity capital in perspective and help policy makers in the Revenue Department take a macro-view while formulating/evolving tax policies governing this asset class, the committee analysed the various sources of revenue.5.11 The study clearly indicates that the potential for generating the largest amount of revenue lies at the portfolio level i.e. with venture capital and private equity backed companies and not at the venture capital and private equity fund vehicle or fund managers themselves. Thus, it is estimated that VCPE backed portfolio companies could potentially generate 85% of taxes on a recurring basis annually. Fund managers could generate 10% of recurring102taxes annually, and the remaining 5% from venture capital and private equity funds in the form of non-recurring capital gains tax over a fund life of 10 -12 years.5.12 Simple, litigation-free tax regime through levying Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on investments and distributions of AIFs can be a game changer in enabling localization of funds and their management in India. The STT approach envisages that AIFs will discharge the tax liabilities of overseas Limited Partners (LPs) and distributions made to foreign LPs if tax free. A tax regime where tax filing and payment obligations of foreign investors are discharged by domestic AIFs will provide comfort to large foreign LPs and enable them to boost their allocation of capital to Indian AIFs. More than 95% of investors in Indian VCPE asset class are overseas investors who do not have any business activity in India apart from investing in India-focused VCPE funds. A simple unambiguous tax regime, akin to the STT approach, will persuade them to directly participate in Indian AIFs, and is clearly the ideal tax framework to facilitate the participation of foreign LPs in AIFs domiciled in India.5.13 Following the major policy initiative of the Government to Make in India, a suitable policy framework would enable venture capital and private equity funds to Manage in India. Also, it makes tremendous economic sense to attract the fund management industry onshore by crafting an appropriate regulatory framework. Taking cognizance of this, the current government has, with best intentions, attempted to correct certain anomalies by introducing Safe Harbour Provisions. However, the benefits under these new provisions are available upon satisfying several stringent and impractical conditions by the venture capital and private equity industry.5.14 Since these issues strike at the very survival of fund managers and the viability of venture capital and private equity funds, unless the current Safe Harbour Provisions in section 9A of the Income Tax Act are amended to address these issues clearly and with certainty, fund managers are not expected to shift their operations to India. By tailoring Safe Harbour Provisions to the special characteristics of venture capital and private equity funds, the conditions can be created for fund managers to shift their operations to India. This can lead to benefits to India in the shape of growth in annual tax revenues for the exchequer. The proposed amendments in the safe-harbour regime are contained in the chapter titled Creating a Favourable Tax Environment.103C. Operational Freedom for Domestic AIFs5.15 Approach to Investor Protection:The other major challenge that any fund manager looking at domiciling in India faces is the extent of operational freedom they have always enjoyed operating offshore. Such investors protect their interests by embedding the principle of alignment of interests in stringent contractual arrangements with fund managers. The regulatory framework in India should aim to achieve parity with the level of operational freedom available to fund managers in international markets in order to increase the inflow of private equity in India.5.16 Piggyback on Conditions Negotiated by Sophisticated Offshore Investors:An emerging domestic-investor-base in India is keen on co-investing with large and global institutional investors in domestic Alternative Investment Funds. Encouraging domestic participation in the venture capital and private equity asset class is also a stated objective of the Government. If the current AIF regulations provide provisions for large sophisticated domestic investors to piggyback on the same protections negotiated by sophisticated offshore investors, SEBI could be the key enabler of promoting domestic participation in this key long term asset class.5.17 Disclosure-based Approach:In the case of venture capital and private equity funds that only raise capital from sophisticated offshore/large domestic investors, a disclosure-based approach should take precedence over investor protection. To manage systemic risk, regulators should be able to clearly monitor and seek appropriate disclosures. Such an approach to regulating AIFs where investor protection is the responsibility of sophisticated investors themselves, whereas disclosures and monitoring is the central focus of the regulator is prevalent in developed economies.5.18 Parity in Operational Freedom for Domestic Fund Managers with Offshore Managers:To encourage fund managers to relocate to India, SEBI needs to evolve a regulatory framework that imparts the same operational freedom to onshore fund managers that is available to offshore fund managers, while not compromising on its mandate. If such a framework is evolved, the majority of104the long-standing demands of the industry to extend the pass-through status to AIFs. However, the amendments also introduced a tax deduction at source (TDS) of 10 % on income distributed by the Funds to its investors. While the intent of the said TDS provisions seem to be to ensure collection of taxes at source, it is important to understand the issues arising and its effect on investors.1.\tGross versus Net IncomeAs per section 194LBB of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (IT Act), wherein any income, other than income in the nature of profits and gains of business or profession is payable to a unit holder of Category I and II AIFs, then such income shall be subject to TDS at the rate of 10% at the time of credit of such income to the account of the payee, or at the time of payment, whichever is earlier.The term Income has been defined under Section 2(24) to include profits and gains from business or profession, dividends, capital gains etc.The language of the section is ambiguous and does not explicitly state whether the taxes need to be deducted at source on gross amounts distributed by the Funds, or on net income chargeable to tax. A plain reading would suggest that the withholding taxes should apply on net income chargeable to tax as the definition of income refers to income computed under the respective heads of income such as a capital gains, profits and gains from business or profession etc. However, in the absence of an explicit clarification, AIFs are in a quandary to decide on whether to deduct on gross or net distributions.2.\tExempt IncomeThe TDS provisions also pose a unique problem on exempt income such as long term capital gains under section 10(38) of the IT Act and Dividends under section 10(34) of the IT Act distributed by AIFs. The cardinal principal of taxation is that there should be no tax on income which is exempt. Any application of TDS provisions on such exempt income would make the exempt income suffer taxes, albeit temporarily. The taxpayer would be free to claim a refund of such taxes ultimately. However, until the refund is claimed and processed, the exempt income would have suffered a tax of 10%.Similarly, the taxpayer himself may be eligible to claim exemption under specific provisions of the IT Act or the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) namely, pension funds, offshore tax residents etc. However, the withholding tax provisions do not provide any exception to taxpayers who are exempt from taxes,106It may be noticed from the above, that the fund manager would deduct TDS under section 194LBB at 10 % on whole of the income distributed of Rs.1, 700 crores, rather than the taxable income of Rs. 50 crores, taking a conservative view, considering the rigorous penal consequences and prosecution for non-compliance of TDS provisions under section 276B and 201 of the IT Act.Even if the fund manager were to deduct TDS under section 194LBB at 10 % on the whole of the book income of Rs. 700 crores, the TDS would be significantly higher by Rs. 60 crores as against the actual tax liability.Hence, the fund manager will end up deducting taxes (about 6 times more than what is actually required) leading to tax refunds for the investors. Further, this affects the funds distribution to its investors and diluting the IRR.4.\tLimited life of AIFTypically, AIFs are setup with limited life of 8  10 years. Where the AIF withholds taxes as detailed above, a significant amount of the taxes paid would be blocked as refund claims which may extend beyond the life time of the AIF, thus causing undue hardship to the AIF and its investors.5.\tLower withholding of taxThe IT Act provides for a mechanism under section 197 whereby, the Assessing Officer upon application by the assessee, issues a nil withholding / lower withholding certificate. However, the certificate under this section can be issued only towards withholding under specified section which does not include section 194LBB of the Act. Even if the section were to be amended, the process of obtaining a nil withholding / lower withholding certificate would itself be cumbersome to the investors as each investor will have to apply and obtain a certificate and the Fund will have to administer the distributions differently for each and every investor.6.\tImplications of withholding tax by foreign entity when it buys assets of AIF It may be noted that, in the case of the unlisted exits made by AIFs, the acquirer in most cases will be a foreign entity and as a precautionary measure, such foreign entity withholds tax from the sale proceeds. This, in turn, affects the funds distribution to its investors and causes substantial stress on the IRR as the investor which is computed on the basis of cash flows.108Recommendations^\tBased on the above analyses, it is recommended that the withholding tax on distributions made by the Fund be abolished, since the investors are subject to tax directly on the income so distributed.^\tThe AIF regulations prescribe minimum investment by each investor and a vast majority of the investors are sophisticated / accredited investors such as banks, insurance companies, high net worth individuals etc. Where the TDS provisions cannot be abolished, the following proposition could be considered:o\tThe sophisticated / accredited investors could be excluded from the applicability of TDS based on a self-declaration of their status and taxability of the income distributed by the Fund in their hands;o\tNon-resident investors who are already subject to the rigour of section 195 could be excluded from the applicability of section 194LBB of the Act; ando\tProvide clarification that the TDS will apply only on net income that is chargeable to tax in the hands of the investors after considering the benefits under applicable DTAA.^\tAs depicted in Exhibit 5.1 above, it may be noted that the taxes deducted at source is higher than the actual tax in any scenario. Consequently, as an alternative, the TDS rate can be reduced to 2% of the net book income instead of the current rate of 10 per cent.^\tAlternatively, the current Venture Capital Fund / AIF tax regime could be replaced with a Securities Transaction Tax (STT) based regime. The STT based regime has been in vogue for a decade in India and is a time tested method of taxation which ensures easy and efficient collection of taxes at source. STT reduces the compliance burden on the Funds to a great extent and ensures upfront collection of taxes to the Revenue. STT could be levied on both entry as well as exit from Funds. STT would also reduce the scrutiny burden of the revenue authorized and consequent reduction in the litigation.E. Securities Transactions Tax (STT) Method of Taxation  A New ApproachThe tax treatment of Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) (collectively referred to as 'Funds') has had a chequered history. The tax treatment of investments made by VCF and Private Equity Funds [now categorizedas Alternative Investment Funds (AIF)] has drifted away from a stable\tnon-109Proposed STT RegimeSTT could be levied on entry as well as exit from the Funds resulting in increased tax collection.\t\tInvestors receive\t\tThe STT methodtax free income\t\tensures timelyas the income\t\tcollection of tax atwould have\t\tsource.suffered STT atthe source itself.Improves ease of doing\t\tScrutiny of\t\tInterests of Revenue is protected and considering the average return on investment, levy of STT would be beneficial resulting in higher levy of taxes (refer Exhibit 5.4).business since filing\t\treturn of incomereturns and claiming\t\tfiled by therefunds would not be\t\tinvestors wouldneeded.\t\treduce to agreat extent onaccount ofexemptiontherebyreducing thecomplianceburden of theinvestors.112Background5.22 While the AIFs have been providing the much needed risk capital, the tax and regulatory environment in which they operate is increasingly becoming more and more complex and litigation prone. In comparison, the tax treatment of Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) investments has been moving towards certainty. For instance, the clarification brought about in the treatment of income earned by FPIs, that it will be treated as capital gains, and the recent clarifications on applicability of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) to FPI have gone a long way in providing certainty to FII investors. Contrast this with the tax treatment of income earned by SEBI-registered VCFs and AIFs. The regime moved from a simplistic treatment of exempting all income earned by VCFs to restricting the exemption to only income from investment in limited sectors, and, from there, again reintroducing the exemption to income from portfolio investments. Recently, the tax regime for Category I and II AIF were introduced whereby income of the AIF in the nature of profits and gains from business were to be taxed in the hands of the Fund only, and income in the nature of capital gains and other sources was to be taxed in the hands of the investors. Further, the income distributed by the Funds were subject to a tax withholding of 10 %.5.23 In addition to the complexities surrounding the withholding and tax treatment of domestic investors, foreign investors have also been facing the heat in the form of stringent scrutiny of relief / benefits under Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements.5.24 All of the above have been slowly discouraging fund managers from setting up Indian-pooled i.e. India-domiciled Alternative Investment Funds, and to instead pool capital outside India for investing in India through the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) route. The investments under the FDI route are not subject to any of the above restrictions.5.25 In light of the above, we have detailed below some of the key issues relating to the current tax treatment of AIFs and their investors, along with recommendations to alleviate the concerns.1.\tCurrent tax treatment of Alternative Investment Funds Domiciled in IndiaUnder the current tax regime, tax pass-through status has been provided to all Category I and II AIFs for income other than Profits and Gains from Business &114Profession (PGBP). Income of the nature of capital gains and Income from other sources are exempt in the hands of AIF and are taxable in the hands of the unit holder / investors directly.Foreign investors are generally taxable at normal tax rates subject to treaty benefits, asunder:20% Long term capital gains; and40 % (foreign company)/ 30 % for short term capital gainsHowever, a significant amount of foreign investments are made from countries withbenefits under the DTAA.Resident investors are liable to tax like any other assessee:20%  Long term capital gains30% Short term capital gainsIncome distributed by AIF to the unit holders / investors is subject to withholding at the rate of 10 %.2.\tIssues under the current treatmentUnder Section 194LBB of the Act, any income distributed by the Fund is subject to Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) at the rate of 10 %.Implications for the FundDetermination of TDS: The TDS provisions are ambiguous on whether the TDS needs to be made on gross or net income; whether TDS has to be made on income chargeable to tax i.e., exclude exempt income from the ambit of TDS. This ambiguity in the law, fear of prosecution and penal consequences would make the fund managers turn conservative and deduct taxes on gross income, irrespective of whether such income is chargeable to tax or not. The conservative treatment by the fund managers could lead to absurd situations, wherein income earned by the Fund, which is in the nature of Dividend and Long term Capital Gains, would be exempt from tax whereas the same income would suffer TDS at the rate of 10% upon distribution to the investors.Tax Compliance: The tax related compliance requirement of Funds has not been reduced over the years. The Fund is still required to file the return of income, and, in addition, is required to submit Form 64A and 64B detailing the income distributed by the Fund. This is in addition to the additional115requirement of submitting TDS returns on income distributed by the Fund,which is otherwise not required to be done by other assessees.Blockage of Refund Claim: On account of TDS on all income distributed by the Fund, irrespective of whether such income is chargeable to tax or not, investors are left with no option but to claim the TDS as a refund by filing a return of income. This means the refund claim would be blocked until the refund is paid, thereby resulting in a sub-optimal return on capital.Litigation Risk: The above ambiguities could lead to situations where the revenue may differ from the interpretations adopted by the Funds, leading to litigation.Inconsistency with Fund Life: In addition, the Fund would need to continue its existence, notwithstanding the fact that most funds are setup with a limited life, on account of completing of assessment and litigation proceedings and realization of refunds.Implications for InvestorsCompliance Burden Hurts Ease of Business: Investors have to file a return of income and claim refund irrespective of whether such income is taxable or not.Working Capital Stress:  Blocked TDS claim on exempt income creates unnecessary stress on the working capital.Litigation Risk:  Increased scrutiny may lead to increased scope for litigation as to taxability of capital gain even though such gains may be protected under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements.Implications for the Revenue AuthoritiesAdministrative Burden:  Increased scrutiny of returns filed by the Fund and the investors towards income and TDS adds to the administrative burden of the Revenue authorities for scrutinizing returns containing exempt income;Reconciliation Mismatch: Administering tax credits and ensuring that the Form 26AS credits match with the credits claimed by the investors adds to the existing reconciliation of mismatches between TDS claims and Form 26AS;116^\tRevenue Leakage due to Interest Cost:  Revenue leakage on account of interest on refunds, which was never to be charged; and^\tLitigation Risk: Increase in litigation leading to poor tax collection andinefficient utilization of tax authorities in fighting tax battles.3.\tNeed of the HourIt is imperative that the existing uncertainties on the tax treatment are removed and a stable and non-controversial tax regime is prescribed. While revenue authorities could try and remove the uncertainties by issuing clarifications and continue with the existing tax regime, it may not be possible to completely eliminate the uncertainties and administrative difficulties unless until the tax treatment is completely revamped. The revenue authorities could therefore consider the following alternative manner of taxing the income earned by the Funds.4.\tSecurities Transaction Tax (STT)  A Time Tested ApproachThis section shows that there is a compelling case for a Securities Transaction Tax regime in the case of venture capital and private equity funds.STT was introduced in 2004 to replace the long-term capital gains tax on securities traded on stock exchanges. The objective of introducing STT was to increase revenue from stock transactions and to create a level playing field for all participants in the stock market. The revenue potential of STT was one of the key drivers of the introduction of STT as the tax was payable irrespective of whether any income arose from it or not. In addition, the STT regime simplified the tax treatment on transaction relating to stocks to a significant extent. Thus leading to a significant reduction in litigation relating to securities transactions on the stock market.The revenue authorities could therefore consider implementing a STT tax structure in the case of VC/PE because of the several benefits associated with it. It ensures:a) the timely collection of taxes at source, thereby ensuring minimal leakage;b) lowers the burden faced by revenue authorities associated with the scrutiny of income tax returns as such income is exempt;c) reduces litigation to a great extent consequent to its structure; andd) enhances the ease of implementation and monitoring.117A non-adversarial STT regime has the following benefits:a)\tFor the FundFunds would be required to collect and remit the STT to the Revenue authorities. STT could be levied on entry as well as exit from the Funds.STT reduces the hassle of filing returns and claiming refunds.It reduces the compliance requirement to a significant extent as compliance will be reduced to STT alone and filing an exempt income return (if prescribed).No further compliance required.Reduced compliance increases the ease of doing business.Funds are not blocked in the form of refunds thereby ensuring returns to investors are not impacted due to the gap between paying tax and receiving returns.b) For investorsInvestors receive tax-free income as the income would have suffered STT at the source itself.The burden of compliance on investors is significantly reduced as investors will not be required to file returns. Even where investors are required to file returns with respect to the income from the Funds, such return would be limited to the disclosure of exempt income only.The scrutiny of return of income filed by investors would reduce to a great extent due to exemption thereby reducing the compliance burden of the investors.No working capital stress as funds would not be locked in the form of refunds.The STT regime would ensure there is no scope of litigation.c)\tFor the revenue authoritiesCollection from investors and remittance of STT to the Government by the Fund on every redemption of units ensures timely collection of tax at source. Since the mechanism is similar to tax deduction at source, the interests of the Revenue are protected.Assured tax collection to the Revenue authorities, as tax would be collected upfront on entry as well as on exit, irrespective of whether1183. Stock Exchanges (in case of listed equity shares)\t\tPay 0.1% STT on purchase and sale of shares by investors (as per Section 98 of the Finance Act, 2004, Chapter VII)Any long term gains exempt in the hands of investors u/s 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, 1961Millions of investors are paying STT and no further compliance is expected from themIn case of non-resident investors, the onus of ensuring remittance of proper tax (if any) is on the banker.6.\tSecurities Transaction Tax (STT) on Alternative Investment Funds - Suggested ApproachGiven that the current STT model of taxation is a time tested one, we have suggested below (see Exhibit 5.3) an indicative STT structure for taxation of AIFs.Exhibit 5.3: Indicative Rates on STT on Alternative Investment FundsUpon investment / purchase of units\t\t0.25%\tof\tthe\tamount\tinvested\t/purchasedUpon Redemption\t\tWhere the income distributed represents income from long term capital assets being securities held for 24 months or more (12 months or more in the case of FPI), 0.25% of the income so distributedWhere the income distributed represents income in the nature of profits and gains from business or profession, short termcapital\tgains\tor\tincome\tfrom othersources 1% of the income so distributed.120Upon secondary transfer of units of the AIFs\t\tWhere the units are held for 24 months or more (12 months or more in the case of FPI), 0.25% of the transfer considerationWhere the units are held for less than 24 months (12 months in the case of FPI), 0.5% of the transfer considerationThe onus to discharge STT would be on the Fund. Fund would be required to collect STT from the buyer as well as the seller and deposit the same to the Government.Rationale for the levy of 0.25% STTIncremental Revenue Collection:  Levy of STT should result in incremental collection of taxes to the Revenue considering that it is levied on gross amounts and is collected irrespective of whether there is a gain or not, i.e., even in the case of losses, the STT would still be levied.The majority of the investments are made by non-resident investors who derive benefits under Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, and which constitutes close to 90% of the capital invested into AIFs. Consequently only 10% of the gains made are taxable in India.Upfront Collection of Revenues: A significant portion of the STT is collected upfront upon investment itself.Overseas investors who constitute a significant portion of the investor base in AIFs typically lose about 3  4 % of gains on account of exchange rate fluctuation, thus resulting in gains which are lesser by 20%  25%, as compared to resident investors.STT is Time-Tested: The levy of STT is a tested concept and has been recently levied on business trusts (Investment Trusts and Real Estate Investment Trusts registered with SEBI) as well. Transactions of sale of unlisted units of a business trust under an offer for sale are subject to STT at the rate of 0.2%.Higher Suggested Rate: Accordingly, the proposed rate of 0.25% upon entry and exit appears to be reasonable. It may also be noted that the STT rate on mutual funds is currently restricted to sale of units with a significantly lower rate of 0.001% as compared to the rate being proposed on the AIFs.Higher Tax Collection as Proposed STT Applicable at 3 points:  Considering that the levy of STT would be both on entry, exit as well as secondary transfers, the levy of STT should result in higher tax collections.121CurrentWithholding tax rate = (J)\t11.54%Long term capital gains tax rate = (K)\t23.07%Short term capital gains and other income tax rate = (L)\t34.61%Proposed STTUpon Investment (M)\t0.25%Upon exit - Long term (N)\t0.25%Upon exit - Short term and Other Income\t1.00%Tax ComputationWithholding tax on income distributed = (B) x [(J) = (P)\t80.75@ current rateCapital Gains TaxLong term Capital Gains Tax (10% being taxable investors) - [I(ii) x (K)] = (Q)\t4.15Short term Capital Gains Tax (10% being taxable investors) - [I(iii) x (L)] = (R)\t2.42Total (Q) + (R) = (S)\t6.58STTUpon Investment - (A) x (M) = (T)\t2.50Upon RedemptionLong term capital gains - Gross - [(C) (i) x\t3.83(N)] = (U)Short term capital gains - Gross - [(D) (i) x\t1.70(O)] = (V)Total STT (T+U+V) = (W)\t8.03Net\tIncremental\tTax\tCollected\tby\t1.45Revenue (S - W) = (X)Conclusion5.26 Flagship Initiatives of the Government of India such as 'Make in India' and 'Digital India' have the potential to create significant industrial growth, increase employment, trade and innovation. However, these initiatives are also capital intensive and require huge participation from the private sector. A robust VC / PE eco-system would assist in providing the capital needed by the private sector and help fund the seed and growth sectors of the economy.1235.27 The increase in VC /PE Funds would surely have a domino effect on the economy. This would result in a positive cascading effect on the tax revenues of the country, in the form of indirect taxes on transactions such as VAT and GST and taxes on the profits earned by corporations. A simpler and certain tax regime for venture capital & private equity funds would go a long way in extending the reach and scale of such funds in India.F. Venture capital and private equity backed portfolio companies - not the Funds - are major sustainable tax generators: Illustration5.28 A Venture Capital / Private Equity (VCPE) fund per se is not a major tax generating entity and it is through portfolio companies that venture capital and private equity funds generate robust tax realisation for the government.5.29 To illustrate this point, take the example of a typical VCPE fund with a corpus of INR 10 Billion. Most often 90% of the fund corpus would be raised from overseas investors who enjoy DTAA (Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement) benefits offshore and other such jurisdictions. The remaining 10% of the corpus would be raised from Indian investors. The majority of the income earned by VCPE funds is long-term capital gains (LTCG). LTCG is exempt in the case of listed securities and is taxed at the rate of 20% in the case of unlisted securities after netting off long term capital losses. Such LTCG is taxed in the hands of Indian investors who form an insignificant proportion of the overall VCPE investment in India, while 90% of the investors who are foreign investors do not pay taxes on capital gains in view of DTAA benefits.5.30 Assuming the Fund achieves a multiple of 2.2 overall and 50% of the exits are through the listed route, the total tax revenue from a Fund with a corpus of INR 10 Billion is merely INR 12 crore over the life of the Fund which is  typically 8 - 10 years  as illustrated below: (see Exhibit 5.5)Exhibit 5.5: Capital Gains Tax Revenue from an AIFParticulars\tAmounts in INR crores\tNotesFund Corpus\t1000\t(A)Overall exit multiple\t2.2\t(B)Total amount realised from exits\t2200\t(C)=(A)*(B)Total long term capital gains (LTCG) for the Fund\t1200\t(D)=(C)- (A)% of LTCG from exits of listed securities\t50%124% of LTGG from exits of unlisted securities\t50%\t(E)% of overseas investors covered under DTAA\t90%% of domestic investorsTotal LTCG subject to tax in India\t60\t(G)=(D)*(E)*(F)Tax on long term capital gains at 20%\t12\t(G)*20%Though a VCPE fund per se is not a major tax generating entity, VCPE funds help create and grow their portfolio investee companies which are taxable entities that can sustain growth in tax revenues - both direct and indirect taxes - for several years.5.31 To illustrate the actual impact that a VCPE fund has on increasing tax realisation on a sustainable basis, we present the following example of a portfolio investee company that the Fund invests in. It is assumed that a fund with a corpus of INR 10 Billion will make twenty investments of INR 50 crore each. Each portfolio company has the potential to grow revenues and profits 2.5 - 3X over a four to five year horizon. We illustrate below (see Exhibit 5.6) the growth trajectory of a typical VCPE funded company and the revenue potential for the government, both from direct and indirect taxes.Exhibit 5.6: Revenue Potential of a Venture Capital / Private Equity Portfolio CompanyINR Crore\tYear 1\tYear 2\tYear 3\tYear 4\tYear 5\tRef\tAssumptionRevenue\t150\t250\t350\t400\t450Indirect Tax (Excise Duty)\t12\t20\t28\t32\t36\t(A) \t8% of revenueSalary costs\t7.5\t12.5\t17.5\t20\t22.5\t\t5% of revenueProfit\tBefore\t12\t20\t28\t32\t36\t\t8% of revenueTaxesDirect Taxes\t3.96\t6.6\t9.24\t10.56\t11.88\t(B) \t33% of PBTPAT\t8.04\t13.4\t18.76\t21.44\t24.12\t\t5% of revenueTDS\ton\t1.5\t2.5\t3.5\t4.0\t4.5\t(C) \t20% of salariesSalariesTotal revenue for\t17.5\t29.1\t40.7\t46.6\t52.4\t(A)+(B)+(C)=government\t\t\t\t\t\t186.35.32 In the above example, the total tax revenue (both direct and indirect taxes) for the government is Rs. 186 crore from one portfolio company over a five year period. Apart the illustration above, there are several other revenuestreams for the government such as service tax, TDS on other payments, VAT, 125state-level taxes, taxes imposed by local authorities and dividend distribution tax which are also paid by these companies. VCPE investors act as a catalyst in placing their portfolio companies on a high growth trajectory which will in turn enables them to raise debt, expand operations, and thus generate profits and employment. Increased tax realisations are a natural outcome of this transformation.5.33\tAssuming that 50% of the Fund's portfolio companies, (i.e. 10 portfolio companies out of the 20 portfolio companies) are successful and achieve similar growth as illustrated in the example above, the total revenue potential for the government from a Rs. 10 Billion Fund's portfolio companies could be to the tune of Rs. 1,863 crore over a five year period, extrapolating the same assumptions. If a fund with INR 10 Billion corpus can create such a multiplier effect on tax revenues, the positive role of VCPE funds in sustainable tax realisations for the government is perfectly well established. It should be noted that about US$ 100 Billion of VCPE investment has happened in India between 2001 and 2014. With this magnitude of investment, the contribution from this industry for boosting tax revenues ona sustainable basis needs to be appreciated.5.34 Given the fact that tax realisations from the VCPE industry comes not from the funds themselves, but from their portfolio companies, the request made by the VCPE industry for restoring the 'pass-through' status for all the categories of AIF is justified. It needs to be understood that this request has been made for better clarity and for avoidance of double taxation. Unlike other funds such as mutual funds, hedge funds etc., VCPE funds have a limited number of institutional investors (typically less than 35) and given that there is a robust audit trail for all transactions, there is no scope for losing track of these income streams and thereby taxes from the Fund.5.35 The above study proves the point that VCPE funds per se are not major tax generating entities whereas the portfolio investee companies backed by funds are robust tax generating entities on a sustainable basis. Based on the establishment of a clearer tax regime for VCPE industry, vast pools of capital can be attracted to India, which has the potential to generate sustainable tax realisation through portfolio companies as illustrated in this chapter.G.\tSuggested Amendments to Income Tax Act to Simplify Taxation of AIFs126Summary of Proposal for Implementing STT5.36 Investment Funds, like mutual funds, pool savings from investors and invest such capital in accordance with a stated investment criteria. A simplified regime for taxation of investors in mutual funds has significantly helped in the growth of that industry, with minimal issues and litigation. A similar regime could provide great impetus to the growth of Alternative Investment Funds.5.37 Presently, there is significant difference in the way income is taxed in the hands of the investors of Mutual Funds and Investment Funds. In the case of Mutual Funds (long-term equity oriented), the redemptions are liable to Securities Transaction Tax (STT) and the net income is exempt in the hands of the investors. However, in the case of Alternative Investment Funds, even though the units are held for a very long duration, the income is taxable in the hands of investors.5.38 Experience suggests that STT has been useful in not only easing the applicable tax regime but also reduced tax litigation. To harmonise the taxation of Mutual Funds and Alternative Investment Funds, and to simplify the taxation compliance of the investor as well as the Alternative Investment Funds, it is proposed to bring Alternative Investment Funds under the ambit of STT.5.39 In short, the investors of the Investment Fund will be made liable to pay STT on the distribution made by the Investment Fund to the investors, and consequently, such distributions should be exempted from tax in the hands of the investors.Recommendation 1Distributions by AIF to be treated as a taxable transaction liable to STT Amendments required in the Finance Act 2004 (Chapter VII):Amending the Chapter VII of Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004 to include distribution from Investment Funds as a taxable transaction in securities:DefinitionsA)\tIn Section 97, of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004, insert the following definitions as sub section (1) :Investment Fund shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (a) of the explanation to Section 115UB of the Income Tax Act, 1961127(ba) in the case of purchase of units of an Investment Fund, the price at which such units are purchased;(bb) in the case of distribution on account of redemption of units of an Investment Fund, such amounts as are distributed to the unit holder including the principal amountredeemed;(bc) in the case of distribution by an Investment Fund other than the distribution referred in clause (bb) above, the amounts so distributed to the unit holder;(bd) in the case of sale of units of an Investment Fund by the unit holder to any person other than the Investment Fund in which such units are held, the price at which such units are soldCollection and Recovery of STTF)\tIn Section 100 insert the following sub-section (2B) after sub-section (2A)The prescribed person in the case of every Investment Fund shall collect the securities transaction tax from every person who purchases or sells or redeems the unit of an Investment Fund.Recognised Stock Exchange or Investment Fund or Mutual Fund to furnish prescribedreturnG)\tIn sub-section (1) of Section 101 -

The regulatory philosophy was7:Create a structure where a regulatory framework is available for all shades of private pools of capital or investment vehicles, so that such funds are channelized in the desired space in a regulated manner without posing systemic risk.Make clear the distinction among the various types of private pooled investment vehicles of institutional or sophisticated investors, to allow the Government/ regulators to tailor- make concessions / relaxations that may be desirable for various types of individual kinds of funds.Provide a framework as a deterrence for fraud and unfair trade practices, and to minimise conflicts of interest.Provide for the private placement of units of alternate investment vehicle, rather than through public offerings.Define the duties of a fund manager to the fund investors as be largely shaped by fund documents that are subject to negotiation between the fund and its investor.Settlement of disputes, if any, were to be settled through mediation, conciliation or arbitration.6.2\tThe AIF Regulations paved the way for various forms of AIF with many new assetclasses and investment strategies made possible in a collective investment vehicle. For instance, for the first time in India, a hedge fund strategy in a collective investment vehicle was permitted. The success of the AIF Regulations is reflected in the number of registrations granted; as on 31 March 2015, 135 registrations had been granted by SEBI8. Recent changes enacted in the Indian tax framework for AIFs specifically and the funds industry generally, coupled with the announcement in the Union Budget 2015 that the Government would permit foreign investment in AIFs9, should give further fillip to this sector.7 http://www.sebi.gov.in/cms/sebi_data/attachdocs/1337601524196.pdf8 The numbers of registrations reflect the number of AIFs that have been granted approval. The AIF Regulations permit a registered AIF to launch schemes from time to time without seeking separate registration.9 The corresponding policy framework is yet to be notified132Principles Underlying Our RecommendationsIn making recommendations, the following principles have been considered:1.\tCurrent and Rationalised ApproachThe approach to regulate pooling vehicles, including AIFs, should be consistent, current and rationalised to reflect the current global and Indian scenario. It should encourage emerging development trends that can shape the future of the Indian economy.2.\tMerging of Boundaries in AIFsThe distinction between venture capital and private equity funds has blurred, especially in the new economy start-ups in India. Investments in the e-commerce sector reflect this trend.3.\tConsistent and Simple FrameworkThe framework should be simple and consistent for the industry to follow and most importantly, be harmonised across the regulators, viz. SEBI, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Department of Economic Affairs/ Financial Services and the Reserve Bank of India.4.\tClaritySharper definitions on investment boundaries for private equity funds would help CBDT rules, especially in relation to non-business vs. business income, as a key administrative issue in fund taxation.133Recommendationsrecommendations in light of the above principles are detailed below.1.\tRegulate the Fund Manager and not the Fund1.1 The origin of the Indian fund industry can be traced back to 1964 when the Indian government, with a view to augment small savings within the country and to channelise these savings to the capital markets, set up the Unit Trust of India.1.2 Owing to new and innovative methods of raising funds from retail investors, there was a need to bridge the regulatory gap on fund raising, which led to the introduction of the SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1993 (MF Regulations). Further, to provide tailor-made boutique/customised investment management services to the investors, SEBI (Portfolio Manager) Regulations, 1993 (PMS Regulations) were notified.1.3 To foster venture capital as a source of funding new entrepreneurs and technology, the Government of India took a policy initiative and announced the SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 (VCF Regulations).1.4 Later, SEBI introduced a comprehensive legal framework in the form of SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (AIF regulations), repealing the VCF Regulations and acknowledging the sectors demand to allow fund managers the flexibility to design fund products to cater to wider investor demand and risk appetites. This would provide targeted concessions to certain funds, as well as to bring within the ambit of regulation, a range of domestic pooling vehicles.1.5 In 2013, the SEBI (Investment Adviser) Regulations (IA Regulations) were introduced to regulate investment advisors who provide investment advice to retail and institutional investors in India. This regulation was brought into effect primarily to safeguard the interests of Indian investors.1.6 The concurrent prevalence of multiple sets of guidelines and the requirements of different regulations have led to a complex regulatory regime for a fund or a fund manager in India. Therefore, there is a need to harmonise and consolidate134all the above regulations, within the framework of SEBI, to create one regulation which shall:reduce the multiplicity of regulations from a fund manager perspective;achieve simplicity, uniformity and consistency in the regulatory regime;provide flexibility to managers to customise product offerings for sophisticated institutional and accredited investors; andprotect retail investors.Recommendations:1.\tThe various regulatory bodies in offshore jurisdictions have formulated regulations to govern the fund manager instead of the fund as it is. The fund manager who makes investment decisions that could pose risks to the investors, markets and the economy (Refer Annexure). A study needs to be undertaken to formulate fund manager regulations based on the regulations prevalent in other countries.2.\tRepeal the following regulations and introduce a regulatory framework/ policy to govern the fund manager such that the fund manager isresponsible for all the investment activities of the client (individual orfund):- SEBI (Portfolio Manager) Regulations, 1993- SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 and- SEBI (Investment Adviser) Regulations, 2013A new Securities and Exchange Board of India (AlternativeInvestment Fund Managers) Regulations(AIFM Regulations) could replace all the above Regulations.3.\tA registered Investment manager under the AIFM Regulations can provide discretionary or non-discretionary investment advisory/ management services to investors who could be an individual/ a group of individuals or to funds whether open-ended/ close-ended or clients seeking customized products.1354.\tThe Investment Manager will have specific capitalization requirements, which could provide for sub-categories based on the nature of the AIFMs business (i.e. discretionary, non-discretionary, customized or collective investments).5.\tThe funds raised by registered investment manager will follow the SEBI guidelines and notify SEBI under an appropriate reporting framework.6.\tAngel Funds/ networks and social venture funds should be separately categorised since they have social venture angle which would benefit the society as a whole. The AIFM Regulations will empower SEBI to recognize Angel Funds/ networks other categories of funds which may require special incentives in future. Reference should be made to the recommendations on Angel investing/Funds in the Chapter titled Unlocking Domestic Capital Pools in this report.7.\tIt is recommended to introduce the concept of accredited investors. Globally, the concept of accredited investors is applied wherein an investor who has a certain minimum income, or assets, or net worth, is considered to be an accredited investor and can make such investments without triggering regulations that apply to fund offerings to retail investors.8.\tThe Chapter on tax in this report recommends the concept of accredited investors in relevant tax provision. An Accredited Investor is defined to include:Individuals or HUFs, company, a firm, an association of persons or a body of individuals whether incorporated or not, a local authority and every artificial juridical person who report a total income (including exempt income) exceeding Rs 50 lacs annually in immediately three assessment years preceding the assessment year in which the investment is made.The diagram of the resultant regulatory framework, should the aforesaid recommendations be adopted, is as follows:1362.2\tBy including growth in the definition of a venture capital fund, a larger quantum of capital shall flow into both early stage and further developmental stages because of the diversification across various stages of a companys development, which is in line with the Governments startup promotion policy.2.3\tThe McKinsey report released by the Minister of State for Finance on 1st July, 2015, titled India Private Equity: Route to Resurgence; has identified an array of benefits to the Indian economy from growthoriented private equity investments.According to the report, the benefits include:A stronger job creation record of PE portfolio companiesSuperior financial performanceGreater export earningsMore acquisitive and global businessBetter corporate governance and higher tax contributionIt is amply clear from evidence supporting the report, that growth investments are socially and economically desirable.2.4\tFinally, growth investing plays a critical role in the case of early stage companies. For example, as early-stage companies with good potential may run out of cash, a stage-agnostic fund can step in directly, or indirectly through their other portfolio companies to provide much needed capital for a start-up to continue pursuing its strategy for eventual take-off.From a categorization perspective, and in view of the above study and current global private equity and venture capital trends, there is merit in including growth investing in the definition of venture capital fund in Category 1 AIF.138RecommendationsWe recommend sub-categorization in Category III AIFs as follows:a. Category III Subcategory A for an AIF which primarily invests in public markets and does not employ leverage including through investment in listed or unlisted derivatives (except for the purpose of hedging the investments) and is long-term oriented with a minimum life of 3 years. Further, the AIF should invest 66% of its investible funds in equity or equity-linked instruments of the investee company and not more than 33% in the debt instruments of such investee company.b. Category III Subcategory B for Complex Trading Fund: funds which employ diverse or complex trading strategies and may employ leverage including through investment in listed or unlisted derivatives.JustificationTo encourage a fund platform which can target investors other than retail investors, like the one discussed above, to be folded into the AIF regime, there is a need to identify such funds which invest solely in listed securities with no leverage or derivative exposure, as a separate sub-category with AIF Category III.This classification will segregate a diverse range of strategies under the Category 3 umbrella into two distinct buckets based on investment horizon, underlying securities and investment objectives. This will further aid in matching investors with appropriate strategies.This option would not require significant tax administration consultation for implementation.3.3\tTen Percent Restriction of Investible FundsChapter III of the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (Regulations) Clause 15(d) of Chapter III states that Category III Alternative Investment Fund shall invest not more than ten percent of the investible funds in one Investee Company. Such definition prescribes various Investment Conditions and Restrictions which needs to be adhered to while making investments by an Alternate Investment Fund (AIF). The term investible funds is defined under Chapter I, clause 2(p) as corpus of the Alternative Investment Fund net of estimated expenditure for administration and management of the fund. Further the term corpus is defined140under Chapter I, clause 2(h) as the total amount of funds committed by investors to the AIF by way of a written contract or any such document as on a particular date.RecommendationAmend the ten percent restriction of investible funds in one Investee Company to reference the market value of such securities at the time of investment.JustificationIt is prudent if the limit is calculated on the market value of the portfolio as on the date of investment. Going by the literal interpretation, the aforesaid limit is to be monitored on the corpus which is defined as the initial amount committed by the investors and not on the market value of the portfolio.For example, if the Fund has raised a corpus of Rs.100 crore during the allotment, the value of which has increased to Rs.150 crore due to market movement, under current regulations the limit of 10% will be applied on the initial amount raised i.e. Rs.100 crore whereas, since the market value of investments of the portfolio of the scheme is Rs.150 crore as on the date of investment.The Way ForwardThe above recommendations, if implemented, would encourage more investments in the economy through the AIF route providing the capital needed for the sustained growth of the economy. We believe the Indian market is ready for an overhaul in the AIF Regulations as discussed in our section 1 above. If, for any reason this is not immediately implemented, then SEBI, in harmony with CBDT, could carry out the above recommendations in a phased manner as follows:The last recommendation i.e. adding growth in the definition of venture capital fund in Category I AIFs and the classification of unlevered public-markets-focused funds into a separate sub-category under Category III AIF, could be implemented immediately as it is a minor amendment to the existing AIF Regulations.The second recommendation i.e. categorisation of AIFs based on whether the securities are listed/ unlisted and leveraged funds could be visited only if the first recommendation i.e. regulating the fund manager is regarded as a measure to be adopted in the medium-term.141Annexure 4Regulating the Fund Manager: Global PracticesVarious regulatory bodies in offshore jurisdictions have formulated regulations to govern the fund manager instead of the fund as it is the fund manager who makes investment decisions that could pose risks to the investors, markets and the economy. To illustrate:The G^30 Report recommends that ^\"Managers of private pools of capital that employ substantial borrowed funds should be required to register with an appropriate national regulator (....). The regulator of such managers should haveauthority to require periodic regulatory reports and public disclosures\tof appropriate information regarding the size, investment style, borrowing, and performance of the funds under management.The European Parliament and Council has come out with a Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) such as Hedge Funds, Private Equity Managers, etc. The salient features of the directives are:o\tA legally binding authorisation and supervisory regime for all AIFM managing AIF in the European Union, irrespective of the legal domicile of the AIF managed with few exceptions.o\tTo operate in the European Union, all AIFM will be required to obtain authorisation from the competent authority of their home Member State.An overview of the AIFM Directive has been provided in Annexure 5.Under the Private Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2010 (The Act), enacted as part of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 2010 (C P Act 2010), Investment Advisers to private funds including hedge funds and private equity funds are required to register with the SEC unless they qualify for one of the exemptions provided such as advisers to Venture Capital Funds, smaller advisers (advising to private funds with AUM less than USD 150 million), foreign private fund advisers, family offices etc.In the IOSCO Consultation Report on Hedge Funds Oversight (June 2009), the IOSCO Task Force suggests that progress towards a consistent and equivalent approach of regulators to hedge fund managers should be a high priority. The Task Force recommends that regulatory oversight for hedge funds should be risk based, focused particularly on the systemically important and/or higher-risk hedge fund managers.142Annexure 5Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive(AIFMD): OverviewScopeThe AIFMD regulates AIFMs; it does not regulate AIFs directly.The main provisions of the directive only apply where the AIFM manages assets of 100 million or more. A higher threshold of 500 million applies to AIFMs that do not use leverage and have a five year lock-in period for their investors.The AIFMD creates a number of exemptions for managers and funds which would otherwise fall within the broad definitions contained in the AIFMD, including holding companies; institutions for occupational retirement provision or pension fund managers; employee participation and employee savings schemes; and securitisation special purpose entities.Minimum Capital RequirementsInternally managed or self-managed funds are required to have 300,000 in initial capital and external managers of one or more funds must have at least 125,000, increasing on a sliding scale to a maximum of 10 million according to the total value of assets under management.LeverageThe AIFM must set a maximum level of leverage for each AIF it manages. The AIFM must comply with this maximum at all times and must be able to demonstrate to its Regulator that the levels set are reasonable.The Regulator will assess the risks which the use of leverage employed by the AIFM could entail and may impose limits on the level of leverage that an AIFM may employ, or other restrictions on the management of the AIF.DelegationAn AIFM must notify its Regulator if it chooses to delegate any of its functions.The AIFM must be able to objectively justify the entire delegation structure and will have to review the services provided by each delegate on an ongoing basis.143It may only delegate its portfolio and/or risk management functions to regulated entities; where this condition cannot be satisfied, delegation is subject to the prior authorisation of the Regulator.ValuationThe valuation function may be carried out by the AIFM itself, or it may appoint an external valuation agent.Where the AIFM decides to carry out the valuation function itself, it must ensure that the process is functionally independent from the portfolio management and remuneration functions of the AIF, and that adequate measures are put in place to mitigate conflicts of interest.Where an external valuer is appointed, the AIFM must be able to demonstrate that the delegation is to an external valuer that is professionally recognised, can furnish professional guarantees and has been appointed pursuant to the AIFMD delegation provisions.Depositary ProvisionsAn AIFM must appoint a single depositary in respect of each AIF it manages.An AIFM cannot act as a depositary. A prime broker acting as a counter party to an AIF may not act as a depositary unless it has functionally and hierarchically separated the performance of its depositary functions from its tasks as prime broker and any potential conflicts of interest are properly identified, managed, monitored and disclosed to the AIF investors.Reporting RequirementsThe AIFMD makes provision for disclosure to investors, both prior to and after their initial investment.The directive provides a detailed list of matters to be disclosed to investors, including but not limited to a description of the investment strategy and objectives of the AIF.The disclosure and reporting requirements under the AIFMD can be split into three groups, these being initial disclosures to investors, ongoing disclosures to investors and information required to be reported to regulators.144AppendixSuggested NonTax AmendmentsList of Suggested Non-Tax AmendmentsI.\tInsurance Companies: Investment in AIFsII.\tBanks: Investment in AIFsIII.\tAngel FundsIV.\tNon Resident Indians : Investment in Units of Investment VehicleV.\tLLPs : Investment objectiveVI.\tOverseas Investment by AIFsVII.\tInvestment Manager : AIFs as Anchor Investors in IPOsVIII.

      "National Strategy for Financial Education2National Strategy for Financial EducationSection IA. Introduction and Background1. The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen a universal recognition for spreading financial literacy among people. The concept of improving financial literacy as a national project has been gradually building. Most of the countries are adopting a unified and coordinated national strategy for financial education. Given the fact that India is having large population, a fast growing economy with national focus on inclusive growth and an urgent need to develop a vibrant and stable financial system, it is all the more necessary to quickly formulate and implement a national strategy. Also since a large number of stakeholders including the central and state governments, financial regulators, financial institutions, civil society, educationists and others are involved in spreading financial literacy; a broad national strategy is a prerequisite to ensure that they work in tandem according to the strategy and not at cross purposes. The formulation and implementation of National Strategy for Financial Education will reap rich benefits to the country and can be attributed to following reasons:a) Inclusive Growth, Financial Inclusion & Financial Education: Financial education play a vital role in making demand side respond to the initiatives of the supply side interventions. Financial inclusion is one of the top most policy priorities of the Government of India. One of the most visible aspects of the governance has been agenda of social inclusion of which financial inclusion is an integral part. Financial literacy, and education, plays a crucial role in financial inclusion, inclusive growth and sustainable prosperity*.b) Knowledge and skill: Increasing range and complexity of products has made it very difficult for an ordinary person to take an informed decision. Financial literacy develops confidence, knowledge and skills to manage*From speech delivered by Honble Union Finance Minister, Shri Pranab Mukherjee during RBI- OECD Workshop on Delivering Financial Literacy in March 20103financial products and services enabling them to have more control of their present and future circumstancesc) Freedom from exploitation: Financial literacy will help in protecting society and individuals against exploitative financial schemes and exorbitant interest rate charged by moneylenders.d) Avoidance of over indebtedness: Financial education will help to avoid over-indebtedness, improve quality of services and make wise financial decisions.e) Promoting entrepreneurship: Small entrepreneurs who would be educated and already have a business sense will benefit through awareness about new financial products and help them to understand the dynamics of market mechanism and improve their business dealings.f) Positive Spill-over effects: Financial education can lead to multiplier effects in the economy. A well educated household would resort to regular savings, which in turn would lead to investment in right channels and income generation. The financial well being of individuals will in turn increase the welfare of the society.g) Shifting of Pension Responsibility from State / Corporations to Individuals: A financially educated person would be in a better position to assess his/her own requirements and make savings in appropriate schemes. It reduces strain on social programs and pension plans, and fosters an economy that is more resilient.h) Behavioral Change: The proliferation of financial products has led to its indiscriminate usage without realizing its financial implications by the user. In fact, the recent global financial crisis has raised the question4whether individuals lack of financial knowledge led them to take out adjustable rate mortgages or incur credit card debt they could not afford.* Financial Education can become an agent of behavioral change.i) Deeper participation in Financial Markets: In India, we need to convert savers into investors. More participation of domestic retail investors in securities market will give dividends by Increasing depth of securities market, reducing dependence on foreign investors and domestic savers reaping benefits of Corporate Growth and reducing strain on Government Treasury for investment in National Infrastructure.2. OECD defines Financial Literacy as a combination of financial awareness, knowledge, skills, attitude and behaviour necessary to make sound financial decisions and ultimately achieve individual financial well being. People achieve financial literacy through a process of financial education.3. OECD defines Financial education as the process by which financial consumers/investors improve their understanding of financial products, concepts and risks and, through information, instruction and/or objective advice, develop the skills and confidence to become more aware of financial risks and opportunities, to make informed choices, to know where to go for help, and to take other effective actions to improve their financial well-being.4. According to OECD, framework of National Strategy for Financial Education promotes a smoother and more sustainable co-operation between regulators and stakeholders, avoids duplication of resources and allows development of articulated and tailored roadmaps with measurable and realistic objectives based on dedicated national assessments.Globally, Countries like Czech Republic, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, and UK have already implemented National Strategy for Financial Education, while many other countries are in the process of formulation and implementation.* From speech delivered by Honble Union Finance Minister, Shri Pranab Mukherjee during RBI- OECD Workshop on Delivering Financial Literacy in March 201055. In India where majority of its population is financially excluded and coexisting with various other financially included sections of population which invest in capital markets and use other advanced financial products, we need a tiered approach under National strategy for spreading awareness about basic financial products to link them to the formal financial sector, educating the existing users of financial products and services to make the informed choices and ensuring consumer protection for all the users of financial products and services. Based on the above trilogy of needs the key components of the national strategy could be a continuum of financial literacy-financial education and consumer protection.6. The key components of financial literacy efforts could be to spread across country some of the following simple messages of day to day finance.-\tWhy Save?-\tWhy invest?-\tWhy insure?-\tWhy you will need regular stream of income post working life pension?-\tWhy save or invest regularly and consistently?-\tWhy insure fully?-\tWhy save with banks?-\tWhy borrow within Limits?-\tWhy borrow from banks?-\tWhat is the difference between saving and investment?-\tWhy borrow for income generating purposes?-\tWhy repay loans?-\tWhy repay loans in time?-\tWhy do you need insurance?-\tWhat is interest? How moneylenders charge very high interest rates?7. The key components of financial education efforts could be6a) Understanding the key financial products one may need throughout ones life  including bank accounts, insurance, retirement savings plans and securities market investments like stocks, bonds and mutual funds.b) Understanding basic financial concepts like compound interest, present and future value of money, annuity, investment return, risk, protection and diversification and so on.c) Developing skills and confidence to be aware of financial risk and opportunities and to benefit from them.d) Making good financial choices about saving, spending, insurance, investing and managing debt throughout ones life: for example, when getting an education, starting a job, buying a house, starting a family, getting ready to retire and living out the senior years.8. The key component of consumer protection efforts at the higher end of the national strategy continuum could bea) Creation of awareness about district, State and National Level Consumer protection foras and providing quick and easy access to users of financial products and services to these bodiesb) Providing quick and easy access to various financial sector ombudsmen and strengthening their network and reach across country.In view of the above, we need to clearly articulate a national strategy for financial education to get everyone on board.B. Vision, Mission, Goals, Strategic Action Plan and Stakeholders1. Vision - A financially aware and empowered IndiaThe vision entails provision of financial education for all Indians that could enableindividuals, at their level of need, to understand the role of money in their life, the need7and use of savings, the advantages of using the formal financial sector and various options to convert their savings into investments, protection through insurance and a realistic recognition of the attributes of these options.2. Mission- To undertake massive Financial Education campaign to help people manage money more effectively to achieve financial well being by accessing appropriate financial products and services through regulated entities with fair and transparent machinery for consumer protection and grievance redressal.To conduct financial education campaign across the country for all sections of the population along with awareness campaigns at different levels for existing and potential customers so as to improve the knowledge, understanding, skills and competence of theirs in managing money effectively to improve his/her financial status by taking informed decision.The mission will be accomplished through provision of financial education throughout the life cycle of an individual starting from the school level. The endeavour is to ensure well being of individuals through financial inclusion.3. Goals- National Strategy for Financial Education has been prepared with the following objectivesa) Create awareness and educate consumers on access to financial services, availability of various types of products and their features.b) Change attitudes to translate knowledge into behaviour.c) Make consumers understand their rights and responsibilities as clients of financial services.4. Action Plan with Timeframe- Given the fast pace of changes in the financial world, it will be reasonable to have a five year timeframe for implementation of the strategy. The above mission will be accomplished only through Strategic Action Plan to be executed in the five year period.8a) To set up the structure as envisaged in this documentb) To incorporate basic financial education in school curricula up to senior secondary levelc) Create awareness about consumer protection and grievances redressal machinery available in the countryd) The Financial Education to be delivered by trained persons in a format suitable to each target group with the content that has been developed by rigorous researche) All the above measures would be undertaken through various stakeholders including NGOs, civil society and by using all channels of mass communicationf) To establish initial contact with 500 million adults, educating them on key saving, protection and investment related products so that they are empowered to take prudent financial decisions5. Stake-holders- The strategy recognises the following stakeholders. The list is indicative, not exhaustive.a) Financial Consumers-Individuals resident in Indiab) Financial Market players-Financial Institutions that act as savings aggregators viz. banks, non banking financial companies, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies etc and Financial Institutions that act as intermediaries such as brokers, merchant bankers, registrars, depositories, exchanges, insurance brokers, corporate agents etc.c) Educational Institutionsd) Non Governmental Organizationse) Financial Sector Regulatorsf) Government- both Central and Stateg) Multilateral international players like OECD, G-20, INFE, etc.9Section IIAssessment of the need of Financial EducationA. National Survey on Financial EducationSeveral Countries such as Australia, New Zealand, France and the USA have conducted detailed survey on the state of financial literacy in their countries. These surveys mainly concern topics related to money management, financial planning, choosing and buying products. International Network on Financial Education (INFE) has also conducted a survey on Financial Literacy across 12 countries. Further, cross country surveys have been carried out for School students and adults. The results of the survey serve various purposes viz.a) Identifying the needs and gaps.b) Establishing the direction of the effort.c) Identifying special groups such as women and illiterates that need attentiond) Serving as an evaluation and benchmarking standard as the result of future initiatives can be measured by comparing with the baseline numbers.While the Groups in India may be different in view of large scale financial exclusion, it is necessary that as a very first step towards financial literacy, a nationwide sample survey may be by different regulators through an outside agency like NCAER etc., shall be carried out for assessing the state of financial inclusion and financial literacy. The survey should have the following elements:a) The state of financial inclusion i.e. Whether the person has Saving Account, Loan Account, Mutual Fund Investment, Insurance Policy, Pension plan etc.b) The state of awareness of financial products viz. how many types of savings and investments options are available to him.c) The state of financial competency viz. whether he understands the concept of compound interest, Present Value of Money, annuity etc.10d) His/her attitude towards money viz. whether he prepares a budget, or consider drawl from credit cards as normal means of financing.e) His/her attitude towards riskf) Whether the person has any pension coverage for old age and if so, the nature of pension that is availableOnce the initial assessment is done the incremental progress can be assessed through reporting by market players to regulators. An effort in this regard is underway across regulators through Technical Group of Sub Committee of FSDC.B. Assessment through Complaints and Creation of Complaint RepositoryThe repository of complaints available with regulators gives an insight of the areas where financial education would be able to improve consumer awareness of various products and also help in addressing gaps in consumer protection.,To use this repository effectively, there is need ofa) Systematic collectionb) Monitoring, andc) Analytical studyof the collected complaints.C. Assessment of Needs through International ExperienceWhile in India, in view of large scale financial exclusion the needs of financially illiterate and excluded may be different from other countries where large sections of populations are financially included, a cursory look at the literature shows that the basic issues in financial education for those already included are not different in most countries. Even as we do not have the results of our survey, a study of international survey will indicate the broad directions that our nation should take. A systemic study by a dedicated team will be necessary.11Ideally, the work of designing the campaigns should be carried out after the results of the survey are available. However, we may follow parallel routes to some extent in view of the following:1.\tWe are starting on our efforts years after other countries have already conducted some surveys. A preliminary look at the survey clearly shows the direction in which we should proceed. Even in developed countries, the state of financial inclusion is far from satisfactory, the financial knowledge quite limited and attitudes either too cavalier or totally risk averse.2.\tLarge quantity of anecdotal material is available through the work carried out by regulators such as RBI, SEBI, IRDA, PFRDA etc. on the one hand and by NGOs and Microfinance Institutions on the other hand. For determining the initial approach, this data bank should be sufficient.D. Efforts made so far in the field of Financial Education1. RBIs initiatives on Financial EducationReserve Bank of India has undertaken a project titled Project Financial Literacy. The objective of this project is to disseminate information regarding the central bank and general banking concepts to various target groups, including school and college students, women, rural and urban poor, defense personnel and senior citizens. The project envisages a multi pronged approach. The project has been designed to be implemented in two modules, one module focusing on the economy, RBI and its activities, and the other module on general banking. The material is created in English and other vernacular languages. It is disseminated to the target audience with the help of banks, local government machinery, schools and colleges through presentations, pamphlets, brochures, films and also through RBIs website.2. SEBIs Initiatives on Financial EducationSecurities Exchange Board of India has embarked financial education on a nationwide campaign. To undertake financial education to various target segments viz. school students, college students, working executives, middle12income group, home makers, retired personnel, self help groups etc., SEBI has empanelled Resource Persons throughout India. The Resource Persons are given training on various aspects of finance and equipped with the knowledge about the financial markets. These SEBI Certified Resource Persons organise workshops to these target segments on various aspects viz. savings, investment, financial planning, banking, insurance, retirement planning etc. More than 3500 workshops have been already conducted in various states covering around two lakh and sixty thousand participants.Investor education programs are conducted by SEBI through investor associations all over the country. Regional seminars are conducted by SEBI through various stakeholders viz. Stock Exchanges, Depositories, Mutual Funds Association, Association of Merchant Bankers etc. SEBI has a dedicated website for investor education wherein study materials are available for dissemination. SEBI also publishes study materials in English and vernacular languages. Under Visit SEBI programme, School and college students are encouraged to visit SEBI and understand its functioning. SEBI has recently set up SEBI Helpline in 14 languages wherein through a toll free number, investors across the country can access and seek information for redressal of their grievances and guidance on various issues.3. IRDAS Initiatives on Financial EducationInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority has taken various initiatives in the area of financial literacy. Awareness programmes have been conducted on television and radio and simple messages about the rights and duties of policyholders, channels available for dispute redressal etc have been disseminated through television and radio as well as the print media through sustained campaigns in English, Hindi and 11 other Indian languages. IRDA conducts an annual seminar on policy holder protection and welfare and also partially sponsors seminars on insurance by consumer bodies. IRDA has got a pan India survey on awareness levels about insurance carried out through the13NCAER in a bid to improve on its strategy of crating insurance awareness. IRDA has also brought out publications of Policyholder Handbooks as well as a comic book series on insurance. A dedicated website for consumer education in insurance is on the verge of launchIRDAs Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS) creates a central repository of grievances across the country and provides for various analyses of data indicative of areas of concern to the insurance policyholder.4. PFRDA Initiatives on Financial EducationThe Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, Indias youngest regulator has been engaged in spreading social security messages to the public. PFRDA has developed FAQ on pension related topics on its web, and has been associated with various non government organizations in India in taking the pension services to the disadvantaged community.PFRDAs initiatives have become more broad-based with direct mass publicity on NPS  both as individual model through POPs and group models through Aggregators. PFRDA has issued advertisements in print media and electronic media through radio and television. PFRDA appointed intermediaries are called Aggregators who are directly responsible for pension awareness mostly in vernacular languages and in line with socio-economic sensibilities5. Market players Initiatives on Financial EducationCommercial banks are increasingly realizing that they are missing out on large segment of financially illiterate and excluded segment of prospective customers. Also, in view of the national emphasis on electronic benefit transfer the commercial banks have initiated various measures for creating awareness through Financial Literacy and Counseling Centers and Rural Self Employment Training Institutes on financial literacy. The objective of these centers is to advise people on gaining access to the financial system including banks, creating14awareness among the public about financial management, counseling people who are struggling to meet their repayment obligations and help them resolve their problems of indebtedness, helping in rehabilitation of borrowers in distress etc. Some of these credit counseling centers even train farmers/women groups to enable them to start their own income generating activities to earn a reasonable livelihood. Even top management of commercial banks is undertaking Outreach visits to villages with a view to spread financial literacy.Similarly, many Stock Exchanges, Broking Houses and Mutual Funds have initiatives in the field of financial education that spawns conducting of seminars, issuance of dos and donts, and newspaper campaigns. Insurance companies too, carry out campaigns and other educational activities for generic education in insurance.It will be necessary to collate all the material developed by these institutions and classify it in the light of the approach outlined in this strategy paper. The cleaned material suitably augmented should form the kernel of knowledge base envisaged in the strategy.E. Mapping of Financial Education Content in the School CurriculaThe most effective way is to weave financial education in the normal content of curriculum. For example, compound interest is taught in Arithmetic as an abstract concept of, A lending to B at some interest rate compounded annually. This can be turned into an opportunity of financial education by weaving into a problem of a company that borrows from a bank or a bank customer who opens a Cumulative Deposit Account instead of a simple Fixed Deposit Account. Similarly, there are opportunities available in the syllabi of Social Studies, Moral Science etc.15Section IIIPolicy DesignA. Components of Financial Education1. Basic Financial EducationThe basic financial education consists of fundamental tenets of financial well being such as importance and advantages of savings, necessity of staying out of unproductive loans that are beyond the capacity to repay, borrowing with formal financial sector, concept of interest and the power of compounding, time value of money, inflation, the need to insure, role of major financial sector institutions such as ministries, regulators, banks, stock exchanges and insurance companies and basic concept regarding relation between risks and rewards. An attempt has to be made to convey these basic concepts to everyone especially to those who are financially excluded at present. However, the modes of delivery can be different depending upon who is the recipient. School children can be reached best through school curricula, employees can be reached through employers, home makers through NGOs and so on. The content and method of presentation has also to be tailored according to the target groups. A large number of financially excluded rural folk will have to be reached through the network of rural branches of banks and Lead district managers of Lead banks.However, it has to be kept in mind that the content has to be sector neutral. The general lessons in prudent financial behavior need to be imparted.Considering the scale of efforts involved, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Government of India should be responsible and take lead in ensuring inclusion of financial literacy material in school curriculum across India through coordination with various boards, ministries and state governments. The Ministry of Finance (MOF), Government of India shall be facilitator for the inclusion of financial literacy in school curriculum through MHRD. Support for course content development and monitoring shall be provided by all concerned as envisaged in Section IV.162. Sector Focused Financial EducationThis component is to be targeted to largely already financially included actual consumers. To begin with four sectors can be identified viz. banking, securities market, insurance and retirement planning. Education for the actual and potential securities market investor may consist of basics of stock exchange mechanism, clearing and settlement mechanism, dematerialization and depositories, and role of various intermediaries such as brokers, merchant bankers, registrars, transfer agents, underwriters etc. Potentially risky areas such as margin trading and derivatives need to be flagged. Various instruments such as shares, mutual funds units, corporate bonds, pension plans etc. needs to be explained.In the same way, bank related financial education should consist of details such as responsibilities under Negotiable Instruments Act, precautions while dealing with ATMs and net banking, fundamentals of payment system, lockers and safe custody, loans and guarantees, fixed versus floating rates of loans etc. Insurance has to cover the basic concepts related to Insurance Sector; life and non life including adequacy of cover, need to pay regular premium etc. Retirement planning should be targeted to all persons in earning age bracket with roles of Pension Fund Manager (PFM) / annuity service providers. The composition of various investment portfolio mix e.g. equity, debt, mutual funds etc. need to be explained. Sector focused financial education has to be totally product neutral. This could be achieved by carefully designing the content. The risk of misselling and steps to ensure understanding of appropriate and suitable products and services also need to be highlighted in sector focused financial education.Considering their expertise and mandate, each regulator shall be responsible for designing/monitoring of study material and implementation of this objective in their respective areas. For example, RBI shall be responsible for banking sector while SEBI shall be responsible for securities markets. Similarly, IRDA and PFRDA would be responsible for insurance and pension related education efforts. Support for content development and monitoring shall be provided as envisaged in Section IV.173. Product EducationFinally, when a financial sector consumer is buying a product or is being convinced to buy a product, it is necessary that he may be educated about the particular product that is being sold. Product education has to be neutral between the various available options within that product range. In view of the above the best agency for delivery of product education would be the respective industry association. Thus IBA, AMFI, FIMMDA, FEDAI etc have to play an important role in this through general campaigns or through ensuring availability of comparative knowledge at points of sale.The more important part of the product education lies with the manufacturer of the product himself. In the financial products, it will translate into the manufacturer i.e. banks, insurance companies, Mutual Funds, Stock Exchanges, Pension Funds etc taking the responsibility of educating the buyer about the appropriateness of the product, performance under various possible scenarios, charge structure through simple examples. It may be noted that the product education can be and should be delivered primarily at the point of sale.The role of the respective regulator will be to ensure that the product manufacturers impart product education in general and at the point of sale in particular. Further, the regulators will have to ensure that the product education is comprehensive while being simple and true.Awareness of Consumer protection and grievance redressal measures: This would primarily be the responsibility of regulators, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Consumer affairs etc. All stakeholders need to provide knowledge about and access to various consumer protection and grievance redressal machinery like sector ombudsman and consumer courts etc.18B. Content of Financial Education1. AttitudeAttitude training should also form a part of financial education. In certain population groups, not caring for the future and living for the moment might be dominating values. Such attitudes are inimical to long term financial well being. Financial education must seek to impart responsible attitudes.2. Financial CompetenciesA core group of financial competencies such as interest calculation, compounding, time value of money etc. needs to be identified and suitably incorporated. Achieving these will be the primary aim of financial education.3. Risk Assessment and ConfidenceMost of the time people are not able to achieve financial well being because of their inability to properly assess the true risk in a deal. They lack the confidence to take a well thought out risk and their financial assets consistently under perform. Building such confidence should be part of financial education.C. Financial Education for the IlliterateIlliterate persons are in most dire need of financial education. Illiterate people need not have to wait for alphabet knowledge as money has its own language, in the sense that even illiterates understand the importance, value and uses of money. In our attempt to spread financial education we usually target the literate persons. The illiterate go under the radar. The traditional curriculum, methodology and delivery channels have to be different and innovative for giving financial education to the illiterate. As argued earlier we need to impart simple messages of financial prudence like importance of savings, borrowing within limits and using formal financial intermediaries. Adult education methodologies like Role plays, charts, informal discussions, games, and other audio visual modes of communication would also be ideal for such groups.19D. Delivery Channels for Financial Education1. School CurriculumGovernments have recognized that financial education should start at school and that people should be educated about financial matters as early as possible in their lives. OECD has developed Guidelines aimed at providing high-level international and non binding guidance to assist policymakers and interested stakeholders in designing, introducing and developing efficient financial education programmes in schools. Such Guidelines can thus be adapted as necessary to national or other jurisdictional circumstances and in particular curriculum and diversity of educational systems.The guidelines specify a consistent and suitable framework for integration of financial education into school curricula. It includes making financial education in school programmes, developing appropriate, tailored and quantifiable goals, keeping the implementation flexible, identifying suitability and sustainability of resources, monitoring progress and impact, ensuring suitable involvement of important key stakeholders, like government, public authorities and educational systems.It needs to clearly be specified that the financial education would not be another subject taught in the schools. What is needed is appropriate integration in the school curriculum. For example, arithmetic curriculum in school already has elements of financial education such as percentage, interest, compounding, discount etc. these need to be presented in a modern setting that the students and the teachers will be able to identify with. Similarly, moral science courses could have content which are based on day to day financial transactions.Financial education is important life skill. Therefore, our educational system should equip students with these necessary life skills, without which, education will be incomplete. In our country there are many students who do not get opportunity to study beyond school level. This is truer in case of girl students. One must keep it in mind that for such students, this could be the last opportunity in life to get formal inputs on20Financial Education. An annexure indicating probable topics for school curriculum is enclosed.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has appreciated the need of financial literacy as an important step to handle personal finance in present and adult life in an informed and skilful way. The CBSE has agreed, in principle, to introduce it in an integral manner in school education (Post Primary Level) and to facilitate the process, a committee of experts has been constituted.2. Social MarketingVarious ministries of Government of India have undertaken commendable programs of social marketing such as polio and small pox eradication, prevention of child marriage, preventing female foeticide etc. These campaigns can serve as models for conducting social marketing initiatives in financial education.There is possibility of making use ofDedicated Financial Education websitesNews papersRadio and TelevisionUse of Social Networking Websites like Facebook and TwitterBooks / magazines in Cartoon Format for young people3. Resource PersonsThe model undertaken by SEBI to impart financial education is by engaging Resource Persons across the country for various target groups. This initiative needs to be taken further and scaled up exponentially. Another easily scalable model as mentioned earlier for large sections of poor people could be conducting literacy courses across country through rural branches and LDMs of banks.4. Adult EducationFinancial education should form an integral part of the adult education.215. Self Help Groups and othersSome of the Self Help Groups have helped in spread of financial education as its discipline requires the groups to maintain accounts and make budgets. The good work needs to be carried forward and put on a firm basis.6. Microfinance InstitutionsMany NGOs have been running successful financial education programs for their borrowers. These programs need to be dovetailed into overall strategy for people in other areas.7. Integrated communication channelsWhile the channels like TV, Radio, Print and internet should be exploited fully; there is a need to leverage the existing extension works and projects carried out by various ministries such as efforts of agriculture ministry to spread knowledge through panchayats etc.8. HelplineThere is a need of multi lingual, toll free helpline where an investor/ customer / client can call and get friendly assistance / support. It should be like a friend who is available to guide you in case of difficulties. All regulators can think of such initiative, if they have not already thought of it. It can play an important role in Financial Education.9. Other ChannelsThere is possibility of making use of other established channelsConsumers AssociationsInvestors AssociationsAssociation of Policy HoldersDeposit holders associationAbove mentioned associations are already doing work related to making their association members aware of their rights and responsibilities in a particular product category. They can further the cause of Financial Education.22Stock Exchanges, AMFI, ANMI, SROs associated with regulatorsRegulated intermediaries like Banks, DPs, brokers, PFMs, Annuity service providers etc. can play important part in making a person financially educated. They can make their consumers/ clients / investors aware of their rights and responsibilities. This can be done as part of product selling process.23Section IVA. Institutional ArrangementThe entire policy is sought to be implemented through existing institutional mechanismThe existing technical Group of Sub-Committee of FSDC on Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy could be morphed into this. This group shall be responsible for periodic monitoring and implementation of National Strategy for Financial EducationNational Institute of Financial Education (NIFE) could be a specialized institute under National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) reporting to the Technical group for implementation of National Strategy for Financial Education.Representative of relevant regulators shall be members of the NIFE. All regulators shall provide funds and manpower to NIFE for implementation of National Strategy for Financial EducationThe main role of NIFE shall be to create financial education material for respective financial sectors. NIFE shall also create and maintain a website exclusively for financial education. All the regulators and ministries websites shall have a link to the NIFE website. NIFE website shall have the details of various education programmes conducted across the country, financial education material including brochures, FAQs, videos etc. All educative materials prepared by individual organizations shall also be made available on the NIFE website. The website should be a one stop repository for all financial education activities and material. The website should also be made available in various regional languages.24The proposed institutional flow chart is given belowFSDCSub-Committee of FSDCTechnical group on Financial Inclusion and Financial LiteracyMoF for Facilitation / MHRD for ImplementationIRDASEBIRBIPFRDAOther MinistriesRepresentatives fromCBSE, NCERT andtwo SCERTsBasic (FE) for adultsBasic (FE) for adultsBasic (FE) for adultsBasic (FE) for adultsBasic FinancialEducation (FE)through schoolsSector specificSector specificSector specificSector specificProduct specificProduct specificProduct specificProduct specificNIFE under NISMMaintenance offinancial educationwebsiteResearchDevelopment of contentData collectionand monitoringof FE25Section VGuidanceGuidance to RegulatorsExtend help to National Institute of Financial Education (NIFE in design of content of Basic Financial Literacy programmes.Extend help to NIFE by way of domain expertise by way of deputing experts for short duration.Extend help to NIFE by acting as interlocutor and facilitator between NIFE and the regulated entities.Use its resources for spreading Financial Education, both Basic Financial Literacy and Sector Specific Financial Education through various channels.Create a Financial Education Cell or Department to lay down the content of the sector specific financial education that would act as source material both for NIFE and the Commercial Financial Institutions while spreading Financial Education.
